 .. Go to *Policies*.
 .. In *Applied policy status*, verify that the latest definition is applied.
 * If the latest definition is applied, click on the More (...) menu and select *Check for implementation updates*.
 * If the latest definition is not applied, update to the latest definition.

. Upgrade each of your API-level policies:
.. In *Policy version*, select the latest version of the included policy.
.. In *Method & resource conditions*, select either *Apply configuration to all API method & resources* or *Apply configuration to specific API method & resources*.
.. Click *Apply*.

[[upgrading-custom-api-level-policies]]

. Upgrade the required extensions and connectors to Java 17.
 * If your custom policy has Anypoint Connectors, see xref:java-support.adoc#anypoint-connectors-and-modules[Upgrading Anypoint Connectors and Modules].

 .. Go to *Policies*.
 .. In *Applied policy status*, verify that the latest definition is applied.
 * If the latest definition is applied, click on the More (...) menu and select *Check for implementation updates*.
 * If the latest definition is not applied, update to the latest definition.

[[upgrading-api-proxies]]
== Upgrading API Proxies

[IMPORTANT]
To ensure your API proxies or Mule apps are protected when upgrading, upgrade your API policies *before* upgrading your API proxies or Mule apps.

The steps to upgrade API proxies to Java 17 differ depending on which deployment model you use. 

* If you use Basic endpoint, deploy the adapted application to the server from Mule runtime and connect it to API Manager using autodiscovery. For more information, see xref:mule-gateway::mule-gateway-config-autodiscovery-mule4.adoc[Configuring Mule Gateway API Autodiscovery in a Mule 4 Application].
* If you use a Basic endpoint API instance to update your instance, update the Mule application connecting to your API instance.

[[cloudhub-and-cloudhub2-deployments]]
=== CloudHub and CloudHub 2.0 Deployments

Before following these steps, ensure your policies are updated. For more information, see <<upgrading-automated-policies>> and <<upgrading-api-level-policies>>. 

. In API Manager, go to *API Administration > Settings*.
. xref:api-manager::edit-api-endpoint-task.adoc[Edit the API instance's configuration settings]:  
 .. In *Runtime Channel*, select the runtime channel to use.
 .. In *Version*, select *4.6.0*.
 .. In *Java version*, select *Java 17*.
 . Click *Save & Apply*.

[[hybrid-deployments]]
=== Hybrid Deployments

Before following these steps, ensure your policies are updated. For more information, see <<upgrading-automated-policies>> and <<upgrading-api-level-policies>>. 

. Deploy Mule runtime engine 4.6 in a new server running on Java 17 and start the server. For more information, see xref:runtime-manager::servers-create.adoc[].
. Select the new target you created running on Java 17 and, in API Manager, go to *API Administration > Settings*.
. xref:api-manager::edit-api-endpoint-task.adoc[Edit the API instance's configuration settings]:  
 .. In *Select target*, select the server running on Java 17 as the target.
. Click *Save & Apply*.
. After the server successfully runs on Java 17, shift your traffic gradually to the new server using a load balancer and turn off the old server after all of its apps are migrated.
