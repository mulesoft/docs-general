[[gov-profiles]]
governance profiles::
A governance profile applies selected governance rulesets to a filtered group of APIs. API Governance then validates the APIs
against the rulesets to determine governance conformance.

// end::governance-profiles[]

// tag::governance-profile-status[]

[[gov-profile-status]]
governance profile status::
You can view profile statuses in the API Governance console. Governance profile statuses are based on the percentage of conformant APIs in the profile:
+
* Normal: 
+ 
More than 70% of APIs are conformant.
+
* At Risk:
+
Less than 70% of APIs are conformant.

// end::governance-profile-status[]

// tag::governance-rulesets[]

[[gov-rulesets]]
governance rulesets::
Governance rulesets are collections of rules, or guidelines, that can be applied over the metadata extracted from APIs in Anypoint Platform. Examples of things you can use governance rulesets to help enforce are:
+
--
* Internal and external best
practice guidelines, such as naming conventions
* Industry-specific government standards, such as encryption for  sensitive API data (HTTPS)
--

//tag::governance-rulesets-subset[]
MuleSoft provides several rulesets in Exchange, such as Anypoint API Best Practices, OpenAPI Best Practices, Authentication Security Best Practices, and Mule API Management Best Practices. Discover rulesets in Exchange by filtering the search by the *Rulesets* type. See xref:exchange::to-find-info.adoc[Search for Assets].

// tag::governed-apis[]

[[governed-apis]]
governed APIs::
APIs are governed if they are identified by the selection criteria of at least one of the governance profiles. If an API is governed, all versions of that API are considered one governed API. Subscription limits are set based on your organization's purchased capacity and the UI gives information about usage and alerts when you are nearing or exceeding your subscription capacity. 

// end::governed-apis[]

// tag::governance-status[]

[[governance-status]]
governance status::
Governance status in the API Governance console shows the number of governed APIs, total number of APIs of supported API types, and subscription limit information.

// end::governance-status[]

// tag::api-conformance[]

[[api-conformance]]
API conformance::
API conformance indicates whether a validated API specification passes all of the required rules in one or more governance rulesets. If an API specification is included in multiple governance profiles, it must pass all of the rulesets in all of those profiles to be conformant.

// end::api-conformance[]

// tag::api-conformance-status[]

[[conformance-status]]
API conformance status::
API conformance status indicates whether the APIs that are included in your governance profiles pass all applied governance rulesets: 
+
--
* Conformant:
+
The APIs pass all applied governance rulesets.
+
* Not Conformant:
+
The APIs fail at least one governance ruleset.
+
* Not Validated:
+
The APIs are not validated because they are not included in a governance profile.
--
+
Versions of an API might have different conformance statuses. Total version conformance status counts are shown in the API Governance console and conformance status indicators are shown for API versions in API Governance, Exchange, and API Manager. 
+
NOTE: API conformance applies only to API types supported by API Governance, such as REST API and AsyncAPI. 

// end::api-conformance-status[]

// tag::nonconformance-severity[]

[[nonconformance-severity]]
nonconformance severity::
Nonconformance severity is categorized by percentage of passed rulesets among all required rulesets:
+
* High Severity:
+
0 - 40% rulesets passed
+
* Medium Severity:
+
41% - 80% rulesets passed
+
* Low Severity: 
+
81% - 99% rulesets passed

// end::nonconformance-severity[]

// tag::project-errors[]

[[project-errors]]
project errors::
Project errors are shown in the Design Center API Designer text editor page. The *Project Errors* section of the page shows functional issues and nonconformance messages found in the API specification that is open in the text editor.

// tag::api-governance-usage-reports[]

[[api-governance-usage-reports]]
API Governance usage reports::
You can view usage reports to gain insight into your monthly usage of API Governance. See xref:general::usage-reports.adoc#api-governance[Viewing Usage Reports for API Governance].

// end::api-governance-usage-reports[]

// tag::api-entire[]

[[api-entire]]
API::
The entire API, including all its aspects. In Anypoint Platform, aspects of an API might also be called just API in context with the product that is managing them. For example, in Exchange, API might refer to the API specification, documentation, and catalog. In API Designer, API might refer to the API specification. In API Catalog, API might refer to the API instance, policies, and contracts. 

// end::api-entire[]

// tag::api-aspects[]

[[api-aspects]]
API aspects::
Parts of an API. Examples of API aspects include specifications, instances, catalog information, and documentation.

// end::api-aspects[]

// tag::api-specifications[]

[[api-specifications]]
API specification::
Details the functional and expected behavior of an API, as well as the fundamental design philosophy and supported data types. It contains both documentation and API definitions to create a contract that people and software can read.

// end::api-specifications[]

// tag::api-implementation[]

[[api-implementation]]
API implementation::
A realization of the API specification to make the API functional.

// end::api-implementation[]

// tag::api-instances[]

[[api-instances]]
API instance::
An instantiation of the API implementation. An API can have multiple instances across different environments and gateways, which can be used by clients to make API calls. Instances that are configured but not deployed are also captured as part of this aspect.
+
An instance can be either a proxy of an API that serves the upstream or an application endpoint.

// end::api-instances[]

// tag::api-documentation[]

[[api-documentation]]
API documentation::
Helps consumers understand and use the API, with content such as examples, use cases, and tutorials.

// end::api-documentation[]

// tag::api-catalog-info[]

[[api-catalog-info]]
API catalog information::
Properties related to an API's entry in an API catalog, such as name, version, owner (contact), tags and categories. 
In Anypoint Platform, these properties are added to the API asset's portal in Exchange.
