[[gov-profiles]]
governance profiles::
A governance profile applies selected governance rulesets to a filtered group of APIs. API Governance then validates the APIs
against the rulesets to determine governance conformance.

// end::governance-profiles[]

// tag::gov-active-profiles[]

[[gov-active-profiles]]
active profiles::
Use active profiles to share API conformance information with developers and notify them of conformance issues. APIs targeted by active profiles are governed APIs and their conformance information is shown across Anypoint Platform.

// end::gov-active-profiles[]

// tag::gov-draft-profiles[]

[[gov-draft-profiles]]
draft profiles::
Use draft profiles to test settings before revealing their targeted APIs' conformance information across Anypoint Platform. APIs targeted by draft profiles are governed, but their conformance information isn't shown outside of the draft profile view unless they're also targeted by an active profile.

// end::gov-draft-profiles[]

// tag::governance-rulesets[]

[[gov-rulesets]]
governance rulesets::
Governance rulesets are collections of rules, or guidelines, that can be applied over the metadata extracted from APIs in Anypoint Platform. Examples of things you can use governance rulesets to help enforce are:
+
--
* Internal and external best
practice guidelines, such as naming conventions
* Industry-specific government standards, such as encryption for  sensitive API data (HTTPS)
--
+

MuleSoft provides several rulesets in Exchange, such as Anypoint API Best Practices, OpenAPI Best Practices, Authentication Security Best Practices, and Mule API Management Best Practices. Discover rulesets in Exchange by filtering the search by the *Rulesets* type. See xref:exchange::to-find-info.adoc[Search for Assets].

// tag::governed-apis[]

[[governed-apis]]
governed APIs::
APIs are governed if they're identified by the selection criteria of at least one governance profile. If an API is governed, all versions of that API are considered one governed API. Subscription limits are set based on your organization's purchased capacity. The UI gives information about usage and shows alerts when you near or exceed your subscription capacity.

// tag::api-conformance[]

[[api-conformance]]
API conformance::
API conformance indicates whether a validated API passes all of the required rules in one or more governance rulesets. If multiple profiles target an API, the API must pass all of the rulesets in all of those profiles to be conformant.
+
API conformance applies only to API types supported by API Governance, such as REST API and AsyncAPI. 

// end::api-conformance[]

// tag::api-entire[]

[[api-entire]]
API::
The entire API, including all its aspects. In Anypoint Platform, aspects of an API might also be called just API in context with the product that is managing them. For example, in Exchange, API might refer to the API specification, documentation, and catalog. In API Designer, API might refer to the API specification. In API Catalog, API might refer to the API instance, policies, and contracts. 

// end::api-entire[]

// tag::api-aspects[]

[[api-aspects]]
API aspects::
Parts of an API. Examples of API aspects include specifications, instances, catalog information, and documentation.

// end::api-aspects[]

// tag::api-specifications[]

[[api-specifications]]
API specification::
Details the functional and expected behavior of an API, as well as the fundamental design philosophy and supported data types. It contains both documentation and API definitions to create a contract that people and software can read.

// end::api-specifications[]

// tag::api-implementation[]

[[api-implementation]]
API implementation::
A realization of the API specification to make the API functional.

// end::api-implementation[]

// tag::api-instances[]

[[api-instances]]
API instance::
An instantiation of the API implementation. An API can have multiple instances across different environments and gateways, which can be used by clients to make API calls. Instances that are configured but not deployed are also captured as part of this aspect.
+
An instance can be either a proxy of an API that serves the upstream or an application endpoint.

// end::api-instances[]

// tag::api-documentation[]

[[api-documentation]]
API documentation::
Helps consumers understand and use the API, with content such as examples, use cases, and tutorials.

// end::api-documentation[]

// tag::api-catalog-info[]

[[api-catalog-info]]
API catalog information::
Properties related to an API's entry in an API catalog, such as name, version, owner (contact), tags, and categories. 
In Anypoint Exchange, these properties are associated with APIs in asset portal information.
