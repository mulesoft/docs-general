Anypoint API Governance usage reports track the maximum number of xref:api-governance::index.adoc#governed-apis[APIs governed] in a given month per business group. 

To calculate usage, MuleSoft tracks the number of governed APIs each business group uses per hour and then identifies the maximum number of APIs governed in a month for each business group. To calculate the total count for Anypoint API Governance, MuleSoft adds the maximum number of governed APIs per month used across all business groups. 

The number of governed APIs (both conformant and non-conformant) shown in the Anypoint API Governance console represents a current snapshot of your usage per business group, while the usage report shows the maximum number of APIs you used in a given month per business group.
