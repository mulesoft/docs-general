= Troubleshooting Usage Reports

Because platform data availability depends on activity in your organization, in some cases, usage reports are unavailable. 

== Unable to Access Usage Reports in Anypoint Platform

Verify that you have the Usage Viewer permission assigned at the root organization level. 

If you don't have the Usage Viewer permission assigned to you, contact the Anypoint Platform organization administrator. 


== A Supported Product Isn't listed

If a supported product isn't listed when you open the product list, click *Switch View*.

For more information about product availability by view, see xref:usage-reports.adoc#products-usage-reports[available products].


== Usage Reports Don't Display Data for Runtime Fabric Apps

include::partial$mule-runtime-metrics.adoc[tag=rtfApps] 

== A Month or a Day is Unavailable in the Date Picker 

If the date picker doesn't show a month or day, data is unavailable for the selected period. 

== Report Says No Data

If you select a product and daily or monthly report in new usage reports, and the report returns a `No Data` message, no data is available for the selected period.

This means that there is no data available for the selected day or month. 

== No Report Available for This Time Period Message

If, after selecting a month in legacy usage reports, the report returns `No report available for this time period`, no data is available for the selected month.

This means there is no data available for the selected month. 

== Deployed Mule App Isn't Listed in the Mule Runtime Usage Report

If a deployed Mule app isn't listed in the Mule Runtime usage report, make sure you're using a supported version of Mule runtime. For more information, see xref:usage-reports.adoc#supported-runtime-versions[supported runtime versions].

Redeploy your Mule apps with a supported Mule runtime version, either manually or during a monthly patching cycle.
