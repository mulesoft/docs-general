To check the health of your API:

. From your Anypoint Platform organization, navigate to Runtime Manager.
+
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/#/console/home/applications["Take me to Runtime Manager^", role="button-primary"]
+
. Select the Sandbox environment. If the Design environment is automatically displayed, switch to the Sandbox environment:
  .. Click the *Design* environment button.
  .. Click *Sandbox*, and then click the *Switch* button.
. Click anywhere in the row for *hello-world-greeting-us-proxy*.

If you've sent a few test requests to the proxy, you can see the traffic in the form of Mule messages in the interface.

Other information you can obtain from Runtime Manager:

* Click *Logs* to review every transaction for the selected app for the last 30 days (up to 100 MB).
* Click *Manage application* to review the settings for this app.
* Click *Insight* to enable Monitoring and Visualizer.

== Developer Deep Dive

The more work your API does, the more data Runtime Manager can provide. To learn more, visit xref:runtime-manager::index.adoc[the Runtime Manager documentation].
