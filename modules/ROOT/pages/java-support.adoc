= Java Support

MuleSoft is adopting Javaâ€™s long-term-support (LTS) release cadence, beginning with Mule Runtime 4.6, which adds support for Java 17 LTS. 

Many third-party vendors are discontinuing support for Java 8, which impacts the MuleSoft product stack. Adopting this new release cadence provides greater security, compliance, and performance.

This change has no immediate impact to Mule applications and Mule Gateway policies and proxies that are running on currently supported Mule versions, or on applications that are upgraded to Mule Runtime 4.6, as existing Java 8 apps will continue to run on Java 8 until February 2026, giving you time to plan for your upgrade to Java 17.

Java 17 upgrade planning includes evaluating connectors, integration apps, Mule Gateway policies, and proxies, as all of these components rely on Java. 

== Mule Runtime Java Support

The following table shows the timeline for Java 8 and Java 17 support:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Mule Version| Release Date |Java Version | End of Standard Support | End of Extended Support
|4.5 Edge | October 2023 |8 | February 2024 | June 2024
|4.6 LTS | February 2024 | 8 and 17 | February 2025 | February 2026
|4.6 Edge | February 2024 |8 and 17| June 2024 | October 2024
|4.7 Edge | June 2024 | 8 and 17 | October 2024 | February 2026 ?
| 4.8 Edge | October 2024 | 8 and 17 | February 2025 | June 2025
| 4.9 LTS | February 2025 | 17 | February 2026 | February 2027
| 4.9 Edge | February 2025 | 17 | June 2025 | October 2025
|===

[NOTE]
Along with the end of support for Java 8 with the Mule Runtime 4.9 release in February 2025, Java 11 will also no longer be available. Plan your upgrade path for apps that are running on both Java 8 and Java 11.


== Upgrading Mule Apps

Before you upgrade your integration apps or Mule Gateway policies and proxies to Java 17, all extensions, modules, and connectors used within those apps and policies must first be Java 17-compatible. 

== Upgrading Anypoint Connectors and Modules

Anypoint Connectors and modules are certified by MuleSoft to run on Java 17. For information about Java 17 support for each connector and module, see the xref:release-notes::connector/anypoint-connector-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes] for that connector or module. Java compatibility information is also provided on the Exchange tiles for connectors and modules. 

The most commonly used Anypoint Connectors and modules are Java 17-compatible now, and others are being released regularly.

To upgrade Anypoint Connectors:

. Update your Mule app to run on Mule Runtime 4.6 or later. 
. In Anypoint Studio, update the connectors in your app to the latest version. 
. Deploy your Mule application:
  * xref:runtime-fabric::/deploy-to-runtime-fabric.adoc[Deploying Apps to Runtime Fabric]
  * xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub/deploy-mule-application-task.adoc[Deploying Apps to CloudHub]
  * xref:hosting::/ch2-deploy.adoc[Deploying Apps to CloudHub 2.0]

== Upgrading Custom Connectors

Custom connectors are any connectors that are not developed and maintained by MuleSoft, including connectors that are built by MuleSoft partners or customers using REST Connect, Java SDK, or XML SDK.

If you are using a custom connector in your app, you must update your connector to run on Java 17 and MuleSoft Runtime 4.6 and later. After you update your connector using Mule SDK, XML SDK, or REST Connect, you must test your app and deploy it.

[calloutlist]
. Update your connector using:
  * xref:mule-sdk/getting-started.adoc[Mule Java SDK]
  * xref:mule-sdk/xml-sdk.adoc[Mule XML SDK]
  * xref:exchange/to-deploy-using-rest-connect.adoc[REST Connect]
. Test your connector using xref:munit/index.adoc[MUnit].
. Deploy your Mule application:
  * xref:runtime-fabric::/deploy-to-runtime-fabric.adoc[Deploying Apps to Runtime Fabric]
  * xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub/deploy-mule-application-task.adoc[Deploying Apps to CloudHub]
  * xref:hosting::/ch2-deploy.adoc[Deploying Apps to CloudHub 2.0]

== Upgrading REST Connect Generated Connectors

For connectors that are generated from an API specification, all you have to do to make the connector Java 17-compatible is republish the API specification to Exchange. 

See xref:exhange/to-deploy-using-rest-connect.adoc[REST Connect Connector Generator].

== Gateway Policies

The MuleSoft-provided out-of-the-box (OOTB) Mule Gateway and Flex Gateway policies and proxies are compatible with Java 17 beginning with the Mule Runtime 4.6 release. These policies and proxies continue to be compatible with Java 8 until February 2025, so it's best to start updating your policies and proxies as soon as possible. 

=== Upgrading OOTB Policies

Updating your policies to be compatible with Java 17 is straightforward when you are using included MuleSoft policies. The steps to upgrade are a little different, depending on which deployment model you use. 


. For CloudHub and CloudHub 2.0 deployments:
 .. Upgrade the policy to the latest version in API Manager.
 .. In API Manager *API Administration* > *Settings*, xref:api-manager/edit-api-endpoint-task.adoc[edit the API instance's configuration settings] to use Mule Runtime 4.6 or later, and select the *Java 17* option.

. For Runtime Fabric and Hybrid deployments:
 .. Create a new server running on Java 17 and connect it to runtime engine agent.
 .. Upgrade the policy to the latest version in API Manager.
 .. Select the new target you created, running on Java 17.
 In API Manager *API Administration* > *Settings*, xref:api-manager/edit-api-endpoint-task.adoc[edit the API instance's configuration settings] to use Mule Runtime 4.6 or later, and select the *Java 17* option. 

Policies that are compatible with Java 17 are listed in:
+
* *Automated Policies* > *Add a policy* page if you are using xref:mule-gateway/policies-automated-applying.adoc[automated policies]
* *API Administration* > *<API-name>* > *Policies* > *Add a policy* page to xref:mule-gateway/policies-included-apply.adoc[apply policies] at the individual API level 
. In Runtime Manager, deploy the updated app to Mule Runtime 4.6 or later instance running on a Java-17 server.
  * xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub/deploy-mule-application-task.adoc[Deploying Apps to CloudHub]
  * xref:hosting::/ch2-deploy.adoc[Deploying Apps to CloudHub 2.0]


=== Upgrading Custom Policies


. Upgrade the required extensions and connectors. 
. Annotate the custom policy definition files. 
. xref:mule-gateway/policies-custom-package.adoc[Package the policy].
. xref:mule-gateway/policies-custom-upload-to-exchange[Upload the custom policy] to API Manager. 
. xref:mule-gateway/policies-custom-flex-getting-started[Publish the custom policy to Exchange]. 
. Apply the policy to the API instance.
. In Runtime Manager, deploy the updated app to Mule Runtime 4.6 or later instance running on a Java-17 server.
  * xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub/deploy-mule-application-task.adoc[Deploying Apps to CloudHub]
