= Java Support

MuleSoft is adopting Java’s long-term-support (LTS) release cadence, beginning with Mule Runtime 4.6, which adds support for Java 17 LTS. 

Many third-party vendors are discontinuing support for Java 8, which impacts the MuleSoft product stack. Adopting this new release cadence provides greater security, compliance, and performance.

This change has no immediate impact to Mule applications and Mule Gateway policies and proxies that are running on currently supported Mule versions, or on applications that are upgraded to Mule Runtime 4.6, as existing Java 8 apps will continue to run on Java 8 until February 2026, giving you time to plan for your upgrade to Java 17.

Java 17 upgrade planning includes evaluating connectors, integration apps, Mule Gateway policies, and proxies, as all of these components rely on Java.

The following table shows the timeline for Java 8 and Java 17 support:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Mule Version| Release Date |Java Version | End of Standard Support | End of Extended Support
|4.5 Edge | October 2023 |8 | February 2024 | June 2024
|4.6 LTS | February 2024 | 8 and 17 | February 2025 | February 2026
|4.6 Edge | February 2024 |8 and 17| June 2024 | October 2024
|4.7 Edge | June 2024 | 8 and 17 | October 2024 | February 2026 ?
| 4.8 Edge | October 2024 | 8 and 17 | February 2025 | June 2025
| 4.9 LTS | February 2025 | 17 | February 2026 | February 2027
| 4.9 Edge | February 2025 | 17 | June 2025 | October 2025
|===

[NOTE]
Along with the end of support for Java 8 with the Mule Runtime 4.9 release in February 2025, Java 11 will also no longer be available. Plan your upgrade path for apps that are running on both Java 8 and Java 11.

[[mule-runtime]]
== Mule Runtime

To take advantage of the improved performance and security of Java 17 xref:mule-runtime::updating-mule-4-versions.adoc[Upgrade to Mule runtime 4.6 or later].

Follow these best practices:

* Upgrade your standalone Mule instances.
* Upgrade on-premises Mule instances that are managed through Runtime Manager.
* Update the Mule version used to build your Mule applications.
* xref:mule-runtime::deploying.adoc[Deploy your applications] to a target running on Mule 4.6 or later.

[mule-apps]
== Mule Apps

The majority of Mule applications currently in use can be updated, tested, and redeployed. However, any apps and connectors that are running custom Java code require additional work to certify these components. Before you upgrade your integration apps or Mule Gateway policies and proxies to Java 17, all extensions, modules, and connectors used within those apps and policies must first be Java 17-compatible. 

[IMPORTANT]
To ensure your API proxies or Mule apps are protected when upgrading, upgrade your API policies *before* upgrading your API proxies or Mule apps.

[[anypoint-connectors-and-modules]]
== Anypoint Connectors and Modules

Anypoint Connectors and modules are certified by MuleSoft to run on Java 17. For information about Java 17 support for each connector and module, see the xref:release-notes::connector/anypoint-connector-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes] for that connector or module. Java compatibility information is also provided on the Exchange tiles for connectors and modules. 

The most commonly used Anypoint Connectors and modules are Java 17-compatible now, and others are being released regularly. See https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000782248&type=1[Java 17 Compatible Anypoint Connectors^] for a list of Java 17-compatible connectors.

To upgrade Anypoint Connectors:

. Update your Mule app to run on Mule Runtime 4.6 or later. 
. Change the target JVM at the project property level. This includes both upgrades and downgrades of the JVM version.
. In Anypoint Studio, update the connectors in your app to the latest Java 17-compatible version. 
. Deploy your Mule application:
  * xref:runtime-fabric::/deploy-to-runtime-fabric.adoc[Deploying Apps to Runtime Fabric]
  * xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub/deploy-mule-application-task.adoc[Deploying Apps to CloudHub]
  * xref:hosting::/ch2-deploy.adoc[Deploying Apps to CloudHub 2.0]

[[custom-connectors]]
=== Custom Connectors

Custom connectors are any connectors that are not developed and maintained by MuleSoft, including connectors that are built by MuleSoft partners using Mule SDK, or XML SDK.

If you are using a custom connector in your app, you must update your connector to run on Java 17 and MuleSoft Runtime 4.6 and later. After you update your connector using Mule Java SDK or XML SDK, you must test your app and deploy it. 

image:java-upgrade-connectors.png[Java upgrade steps for connectors]

[calloutlist]
. Update your connector using:
  * xref:mule-sdk/getting-started.adoc[Mule Java SDK]
  * xref:mule-sdk/xml-sdk.adoc[Mule XML SDK]
. Test your connector using xref:munit/index.adoc[MUnit].
. Deploy your Mule application:
  * xref:runtime-fabric::/deploy-to-runtime-fabric.adoc[Deploying Apps to Runtime Fabric]
  * xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub/deploy-mule-application-task.adoc[Deploying Apps to CloudHub]
  * xref:hosting::/ch2-deploy.adoc[Deploying Apps to CloudHub 2.0]

[[rest-connect-generated-connectors]]
=== REST Connect Generated Connectors

For connectors that are generated from an API specification using the REST Connect connector generator tool, all you have to do to make the connector Java 17-compatible is republish the API specification to Exchange. 

See xref:exhange/to-deploy-using-rest-connect.adoc[REST Connect Connector Generator].

[[api-policies]]
== API Policies

The MuleSoft-included Mule Gateway and Flex Gateway policies and proxies are compatible with Java 17 beginning with the Mule Runtime 4.6 release. These policies and proxies continue to be compatible with Java 8 until February 2025, so it's best to start updating your policies and proxies as soon as possible. 

[IMPORTANT]
To ensure your API proxies or Mule apps are protected when upgrading, upgrade your API policies *before* upgrading your API proxies or Mule apps.

See xref:upgrade-api-policies-proxies.adoc[Upgrade Java for API Policies and Proxies]

[[api-proxies]]
== API Proxies

MuleSoft-included API proxies are compatible with Java 17 beginning with the Mule runtime 4.6 release. These API proxies continue to be compatible with Java 8 until February 2025, so it’s best to start updating your API proxies as soon as possible. 

The steps to upgrade are a little different, depending on which deployment model you use. 

* If you use Basic endpoint, deploy the adapted application to the server from Mule runtime and connect it to API Manager using autodiscovery. For more information, refer to <<Update Mule runtime docs in J17 landing page>>
* If you use a Basic endpoint API instance to update your instance, update the Mule application connecting to your API instance.

[IMPORTANT]
To ensure your API proxies or Mule apps are protected when upgrading, upgrade your API policies *before* upgrading your API proxies or Mule apps.

For details about how to upgrade your API proxies, see xref:upgrade-api-policies-proxies.adoc[]

[[mule-maven-plugin]]
== Mule Maven Plugin 
(REVIEWERS: For this section, is there a dependency on Studio, so this should wait until the Studio release?)

If you are using Mule Maven Plugin (MMP) to deploy your apps, configure the deployment to use Java 17.  

When deploying to CloudHub, MMP deploys the latest build version of a release train when it's given a major and minor version. MMP has a new Java version property to explicitly deploy to a specified Java version.

When deploying to Runtime Fabric (RTF) and CloudHub 2.0, MMP accepts the entire tag of the build so you can use the correct semantic version (SemVer) in your deployment. 

See the following documentation for more information:

* xref:cloudhub-2/ch2-deploy-maven.adoc[Deploying apps to CloudHub 2.0 using the Maven Plugin]
* xref:runtime-fabric/latest/deploy-maven-4.x.adoc[Deploying Applications to Runtime Fabric Using Maven]

[[dataweave]]
== DataWeave

DataWeave uses Java’s reflection API to read and write Java objects and Java 17 adds some restrictions in encapsulation and reflective access that affect the Java Data Format.

To ensure that your applications continue to work as expected, follow these guidelines:

* Verify that the objects used by your application are Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs). 
+
POJOs are required from now on and you must also ensure that POJOs have:

* Default constructor
* Getters for all properties
* Setters for all properties

See the DataWeave documentation for more information. [LINK TO DATAWEAVE DOCS]
