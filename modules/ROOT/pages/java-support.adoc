= Java Support

MuleSoft is adopting Javaâ€™s long-term-support (LTS) release cadence, beginning with Mule Runtime 4.6, which adds support for Java 17 LTS. 

Many third-party vendors are discontinuing support for Java 8, which impacts the MuleSoft product stack. Adopting this new release cadence provides greater security, compliance, and performance.

This change has no immediate impact to Mule applications and Mule Gateway policies and proxies that are running on currently supported Mule versions, or on applications that are upgraded to Mule Runtime 4.6, as existing Java 8 apps will continue to run on Java 8 until February 2026, giving you time to plan for your upgrade to Java 17.

Java 17 upgrade planning includes evaluating connectors, integration apps, Mule Gateway policies, and proxies, as all of these components rely on Java. 

== Mule Runtime Java Support

The following table shows the timeline for Java 8 and Java 17 support:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Mule Version| Release Date |Java Version | End of Standard Support | End of Extended Support
|4.5 Edge | October 2023 |8 | February 2024 | June 2024
|4.6 LTS | February 2024 | 8 and 17 | February 2025 | February 2026
|4.6 Edge | February 2024 |8 and 17| June 2024 | October 2024
|4.7 Edge | June 2024 | 8 and 17 | October 2024 | February 2026 ?
| 4.8 Edge | October 2024 | 8 and 17 | February 2025 | June 2025
| 4.9 LTS | February 2025 | 17 | February 2026 | February 2027
| 4.9 Edge | February 2025 | 17 | June 2025 | October 2025
|===

[NOTE]
Along with the end of support for Java 8 with the Mule Runtime 4.9 release in February 2025, Java 11 will also no longer be available. Plan your upgrade path for apps that are running on both Java 8 and Java 11.


== Upgrading Mule Apps

Before you upgrade your integration apps or Mule Gateway policies and proxies to Java 17, all extensions, modules, and connectors used within those apps and policies must first be Java 17-compatible. 

== Anypoint Connectors and Modules

Anypoint Connectors and modules are certified by MuleSoft to run on Java 17. For information about Java 17 support for each connector and module, see the xref:release-notes::connector/anypoint-connector-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes] for that connector or module. Java compatibility information is also provided on the Exchange tiles for connectors and modules. 

The most commonly used Anypoint Connectors and modules are Java 17-compatible now, and others are being released regularly. 

== Custom Connectors

Custom connectors are any connectors that are not developed and maintained by MuleSoft, including connectors that are built by MuleSoft partners using REST Connect, Mule SDK, or XML SDK.

If you are using a custom connector in your app, you must update your connector to run on Java 17 and MuleSoft Runtime 4.6 and later. After you update your connector using Mule SDK, XML SDK, or REST Connect, you must test your app and deploy it.
