Your customers and employees need data-rich, delightful digital experiences on a variety of devices from smart watches to desktop computers. To deliver these experiences, your systems must be connected to each other, and the data must flow among those systems (integration).

The MuleSoft approach to integration, https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/api-dev/what-is-api-led-connectivity/[integration of data from different systems using a layer of APIs], allows you to spend less time on IT projects and more time on your core business. Whenever you turn a business process into an API, you make it easier to implement that process in the next project. And APIs have proven to be the best size of reusable code.

Anypoint Platform helps you build a structured application network that connects applications, data, and devices with reusable APIs.
The unified Anypoint Platform makes it easy to discover, create, and manage APIs in a modular, organized layer. Instead of retrieving random and possibly unstable code snippets, you can “shop” for APIs created using the industry’s best practices.

== Explore Anypoint Exchange

The APIs you build in MuleSoft to integrate applications and services are, by design, reusable and built with enterprise security in mind.
You can discover these APIs, as well as connectors, samples, and templates in
https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange^].

Exchange also provides RAML fragments, custom packages, videos, links to documentation, and other assets.

Discover Anypoint Platform APIs on https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/[the MuleSoft developer portal^].

== Design and Build API-based Integrations

Anypoint Studio is an Eclipse-based IDE that helps you create integrations. Design Center, a web-based tool, helps you create API specifications, the foundation for data integrations.
