Your customers and employees need data-rich, delightful digital experiences on a variety of devices from smart watches to desktop computers. To deliver these experiences, your systems must be connected to each other, and the data must flow among those systems (integration).

The MuleSoft approach to integration, https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/api-dev/what-is-api-led-connectivity/[integration of data from different systems using a layer of APIs], allows you to spend less time on IT projects and more time on your core business. Whenever you turn a business process into an API, you make it easier to implement that process in the next project.

Anypoint Platform enables you to build a structured application network that uses reusable APIs to connect applications, data, and devices.
Anypoint Platform makes it easy to discover, create, and manage APIs in a modular, organized layer. Instead of retrieving random (and possibly unstable) code snippets, you can discover and use APIs that are created using the industryâ€™s best practices.

== Exploring Anypoint Exchange

The APIs you build in Anypoint Platform to integrate applications and services are reusable and include enterprise-level security.
You can discover these APIs, as well as connectors, samples, and templates, in
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange^].

Exchange also provides RAML fragments, custom packages, videos, links to documentation, and other assets.

Discover Anypoint Platform APIs on https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/[the MuleSoft developer portal^].

== Designing and Building API-Based Integrations

Anypoint Studio is an Eclipse-based IDE that enables you to create integrations. Design Center, a web-based tool, enables you to create API specifications, which are the foundation for these integrations.

Anypoint Studio 7.0 and later includes xref:mule-runtime::index.adoc[Mule runtime engine (Mule) 4], the runtime environment in which you deploy Mule apps and APIs.
Earlier versions of Studio include xref:3.9@mule-runtime::index.adoc[Mule 3].

== Testing Integrations

It is best practice to test the integrations you create before you deploy them:

* xref:2.1@munit::index.adoc[Testing with MUnit]
* xref:runtime-manager::troubleshooting.adoc[Troubleshooting]

== Deploying Integrations

After you test your integration, deploy it to a production environment:

* xref:runtime-manager::deployment-strategies.adoc[Choosing a Deployment Strategy]
* xref:3.9@mule-runtime::installing.adoc#mule-installation-procedure[Installing Standalone Mule 3]
* xref:mule-runtime::runtime-installation-task.adoc[Installing Standalone Mule 4]

== Managing Integrations

After your integration is running in production, monitor its performance:

* xref:monitoring::index.adoc[Anypoint Monitoring]
* xref:api-functional-monitoring::index.adoc[API Functional Monitoring]
* xref:runtime-manager::monitoring.adoc[Runtime Monitoring]

== Managing Anypoint Platform Features

Either during the development cycle or after deployment, you can make changes to your integration:

* xref:design-center::index.adoc[Design Center]
* xref:2.x@api-manager::latest-overview-concept.adoc[API Manager]
* xref:access-management::index.adoc[Access Management]
