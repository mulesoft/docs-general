= Step 5. Deploy the API to CloudHub

endif::[]

Now that you've created and tested the Mule app that contains your new API from
within Studio, let's deploy the API to CloudHub. First, we'll create an API proxy,
which then enables us to test the API from Exchange. Then, we'll then set up a rate-limiting policy to protect our API from a denial-of-service attack.

== Step 5.1: Deploy API to CloudHub 

To deploy this API in the form of a Mule app:

. From Studio, in the Mule Design perspective, right-click the `hello-world` project in Package Explorer,
and then select *Anypoint Platform > Deploy to CloudHub*.
. If prompted, enter your Anypoint Platform username and password and click *Sign in*.
+

. You must be in your account's sandbox to deploy the API. If you see *Design* instead of *Sandbox*:
  .. Click *Design* to launch the Switch Environment dialog.
  .. Click *Sandbox*.
  .. Click *Switch*.
. Enter `hello-world-greeting-firstname-lastname`; every app and API name must be unique across CloudHub. This example uses `hello-world-greeting-sandy-kim`.
. Verify that *Deployment Target* is `CloudHub`.
. Don't change any of the other default values.
. Click *Deploy Application*. After a brief pause, a window displays the status of the deployment.
. Click *Open in Browser* to see the status displayed in Runtime Manager.
+

+
When the project has been successfully deployed, Runtime Manager displays the status *Started*.
. To test the API deployment, send a request from Advanced Rest Client:
  .. Click *Started* to display the *App url*.
  .. Copy the value: `hello-world-greeting.sandy-kim.us-e2.cloudhub.io` for this example.
  .. In Advanced Rest Client, send a request to the base URI that you just copied. Be sure to add the API endpoint `/greeting`:
+
[source, xml]
----
GET http://hello-world-greeting.sandy-kim.us-e2.cloudhub.io/api/greeting
----

  .. If you see `200 OK` and the greeting you specified, `Today the greeting is Hello.`, then you have successfully deployed the API you created.

Now we need to create an API proxy application for this API, to restrict access and keep the service protected.
We'll add a rate-limiting policy, which we can do this while the API is running.

== Step 5.2: Create an API Proxy Application

In order to add a rate limit policy to our deployed API, we must first add our API to API Manager, and create an API proxy.

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
+
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login["Take me to Anypoint Platform^", role="button-primary"]

. Click *API Manager*.
. Switch to the sandbox environment.
. Click *Manage API > Manage API from Exchange*.
. Enter `hello` and select `hello-world` from the drop-down. Note you are working with the API, not the deployed app named `hello-world-greeting`.
. Verify the following values are selected:
  ** *Asset type: RAML/OAS*
  ** *API version: v1*
  ** *Asset version: 1.0.1*
  ** *Managing type: Endpoint with Proxy*
  ** *Proxy deployment target: CloudHub*
  ** *Mule version:* Check the checkbox for Mule 4
  ** Implementation URI: `\http://hello-world-greeting-sandy-kim.us-e2.cloudhub.io/api`. This is the same value as the *App url* from Step 1, with `/api` appended.
  ** You can ignore TLS context since our API simply returns a hard-coded value.
  ** Path: `/`
  ** Ignore Advanced options.
. Click *Save*.

API Manager shows you a status page for your new proxy.

Now that our API is managed in API Manager, we can create a proxy in the next step.

== Step 5.3. Configure the API Proxy

To create a proxy for the API:

. If you aren't on the API Manager `hello-world` API settings page from the previous step, navigate there:
+
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login["Take me to Anypoint Platform^", role="button-primary"]
. Click *API Manager*.
. Click *hello-world* to open the drop-down.
. Click *v1* to display the proxy settings page.
. In the top section:
  ** Click *Add a label*.
  ** Enter *No policy* and press Return to save the label.
. In the Deployment Configuration section:
  ** Select *Runtime version: 4.2.2* or a later version if available.
  ** For *Proxy application name*, which is the name displayed in Runtime Manager, enter *hello-world-greeting-proxy*, but append your last name or other unique string to ensure the proxy name is unique. The deploy button won't be enabled until you enter a valid value here.
  ** Select *Update application if exists*.
. Click *Deploy*. A progress window displays.
. When deployment is complete, close the progress dialog to return to the settings page.

Now you have an implmentation URL that you don't want to share with the world, and a proxy URL which will be safe to share with the world once we configure it.

image:proxy-deploy2.png[settings page showing URLs, 600]

To configure the proxy:

. In the *Proxy* section, right-click the link after *Proxy URL* and copy the link.
. At the top of the page, click *Add consumer endpoint*.
. Paste in the link you just copied, and press Return to save the link.

Now you can test the proxy endpoint from Exchange:

. Click *View API in Exchange*.
+
image:exchange-page-for-proxy.png[Exchange page for hello-world proxy, 600]

. Click *API instances*. You can see the Mocking Service version and the new proxy you just created in the Sandbox environment, labeled "no policy".
. On the left side, click */greeting* to open, then click *GET*.
. On the right side, toward the top of the column, click *Mocking Service* to open the drop-down menu.
. Select *Sandbox: No policy instance*
. Click *Send*. The response should be `200 OK` and the greeting `Today the greeting is Hello.`

Finish configuring the proxy:

. Click *API instances* to return to the list of API instances in Exchange.
. Select your API.
. Click *Private* and then choose *Public*.

== Step 5.4: Add a Rate Limit Policy

To add a rate limit policy:

. Return to API Manager.
. Click *hello-world*.
. Click *v1*.
. In the navigation on the left, select *Policies*.
. Click *Apply New Policy*.
. Don't change the default *All Mule Versions*.
. Scroll to locate *Rate limiting* (not *Rate limiting - SLA based*).
. Click *Rate limiting*, select *1.3.3*, and click *Configure Policy*.
. In the Apply Rate limiting policy page, set the limit values:
  ** *# of Reqs*: `3`
  ** *Time Period*: `1`
  ** *Time Unit*: *Minute*
. Select *Expose Headers*.
. Select  *Method & Resource conditions*: *Apply configurations to all API methods & resources*
. Click *Apply*.

The new policy is displayed at the bottom of the Policies home page.

Change the API instance label so it reflects the fact that we now have a policy on the proxy:

. Click *Settings*.
. Click the edit pencil next to *Label* and change the value to `Rate-limiting policy`.

Test the new policy:

In Advanced Rest Client, send GET requests to the API proxy `\http://hello-world-greeting-proxy.us-e2.cloudhub.io/greeting` (the consumer endpoint plus `/greeting`) multiple times, until you receive the response `429 Too Many Requests`.

== What's Next

Now that your API is deployed as a Mule app to Mule in CloudHub, you can manage it using Anypoint Platform tools.

MuleSoft provides many deployment options, described in xref:mule-runtime::deploying.adoc[Deploy Mule Applications].
