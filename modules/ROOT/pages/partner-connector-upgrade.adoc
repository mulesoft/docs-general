= Upgrading Java for Custom Connectors (Partners)

NOTE: This guide applies to MuleSoft partners only. If you are a MuleSoft customer, see xref:customer-connector-upgrade.adoc[].

Upgrade, test, and release your custom connectors for Java 17 to ensure compatibility within the MuleSoft ecosystem. 

include::partial$partner-and-customer-guide.adoc[tags=before-you-begin]

To decouple the minimum Mule version when running tests, add the `-Dmunit.jvm` parameter to use Java 17 as described in <<test-for-java-17-compatibility-directly>>.

== Upgrading Your Custom REST SDK Connectors

Use REST SDK version 0.8.0-RC4 to upgrade your custom REST SDK connectors to Java 17. 

REST SDK 0.8.0-RC4 generates Java 17-compatible connectors and maintains backward compatibility only with REST SDK 0.8.0-RC3 connectors built without Java customizations. Version 0.8.0-RC4 is not backward-compatible with REST SDK versions earlier than 0.8.0-RC3. 

When upgrading REST SDK connectors to Java 17:

* For REST SDK version 0.8.0-RC3 and earlier connectors with Java customizations, regenerate the connector with REST SDK 0.8.0-RC4 and port over any Java customizations. 
+
The resulting connector likely breaks compatibility with the previous version of the connector.

* For REST SDK 0.8.0-RC3 and earlier connectors without Java customizations, regenerate the connector with REST SDK 0.8.0-RC4. 
+
The resulting connector is backward-compatible with the previous version.

For more information about REST SDK, see https://beta.docs.mulesoft.com/beta-mule-sdk/mule-sdk/1.1/rest-sdk/rest-sdk-connectivity[REST SDK]. 

=== Upgrade an Existing Custom REST SDK Connector

If you previously generated a connector using REST SDK and you want to make that connector compatible with Java 17:

. Upgrade the REST SDK components and dependencies to version 0.8.0-RC4:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<parent>
   <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectivity</groupId>
   <artifactId>rest-sdk-connector-parent-pom</artifactId>
   <version>0.8.0-RC4</version>
</parent>

<rest.sdk.commons.version>0.8.0-RC4</rest.sdk.commons.version>
<rest.sdk.mojo.version>0.8.0-RC4</rest.sdk.mojo.version>
----
. If you manually create the configuration class (`ConnectorNameConfiguration.java`) using the REST SDK override feature, you must add an extra annotation: 
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
import org.mule.sdk.api.annotation.JavaVersionSupport;
import org.mule.sdk.api.meta.JavaVersion;

@JavaVersionSupport({JavaVersion.JAVA_8, JavaVersion.JAVA_11, JavaVersion.JAVA_17})

public class YourConnectorConfiguration
----
. Regenerate the connector.

=== Upgrade a New Custom REST SDK Connector

If you generate a new connector using REST SDK and want to make that connector compatible with Java 17:

. Upgrade the REST SDK components and dependencies to version 0.8.0-RC4:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<parent>
   <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectivity</groupId>
   <artifactId>rest-sdk-connector-parent-pom</artifactId>
   <version>0.8.0-RC4</version>
</parent>

<rest.sdk.commons.version>0.8.0-RC4</rest.sdk.commons.version>
<rest.sdk.mojo.version>0.8.0-RC4</rest.sdk.mojo.version>
---- 
. Upgrade the Mule runtime version to 4.6.0.

[[test-your-custom-connector-with-mtf]]
== Testing Your Custom Connector with MTF

Test your custom connector with Module Testing Framework (MTF) to ensure Java 17 compatibility. For more information about MTF, see https://beta.docs.mulesoft.com/beta-mtf/mule-sdk/1.1/mtf[MTF]. 

=== Set Up Your Build

Ensure your pipeline runs against all supported Java versions (Java 8, Java 11, and Java 17). The following example shows a single build pipeline that is configured to run tests against all supported Java versions, in which `default` corresponds to Java 17:

image:single-build-pipeline.png[Example of single build pipeline]

The pipeline runs all tests even if the previous tests fail. For example, the pipeline runs Java 17 tests even if the Java 11 tests fail. 

Although the pipeline contains multiple tests, the pipeline has one compilation phase and one release phase, which targets Java 8.

=== Run an Initial Test

Run an initial test to test your custom connector for Java 17 compatibility. You can continue to run tests as you change the custom connector code:

. In the `pom.xml` file of your custom connector, update the munit-extensions-maven-plugin configuration to include the following configuration (the `jacoco.version` property must be 0.8.10 or later): 
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<argLines>
         <argLine>                      -javaagent:${settings.localRepository}/org/jacoco/org.jacoco.agent/${jacoco.version}/org.jacoco.agent-${jacoco.version}-runtime.jar=destfile=${session.executionRootDirectory}/target/jacoco-munit.exec</argLine>
</argLines>
----
. Run your MTF test to generate the coverage report.

=== View your Coverage Report

View your coverage report to see your custom connector coverage. You must have at least 80% coverage for a high certainty of Java 17 compatibility. 

. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
. Go to *Run* > *Show Coverage Data*.
. In *Choose Coverage Suite to Display*, add `jacoco-munit.exec` to the list if it's not there already.
. Look at the coverage percentages to analyze your results.

=== Add the JDeps Maven Plugin

JDeps is a tool for static code analysis that detects the usage of JDK internal APIs that are no longer available or accessible. For more information, refer to the https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/JDK8/Java+Dependency+Analysis+Tool[OpenJDK wiki]. 

Add the JDeps Maven plugin to your custom connector’s `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-jdeps-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.2</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
               <goal>jdkinternals</goal> <!-- verify main classes -->
               <goal>test-jdkinternals</goal> <!-- verify test classes -->
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <failOnWarning>true</failOnWarning>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

=== Test for Java 17 Compatibility 

You can test for Java 17 compatibility running on either Java 11 or Java 17. 

If you are running on Java 11, you can perform early validations by adding a parameter for illegal reflective access. See <<add-a-parameter-for-illegal-reflective-access>>.

If you are running on Java 17, you can test for Java 17 directly. See <<test-for-java-17-compatibility-directly>>.

[[add-a-parameter-for-illegal-reflective-access]]
==== Add a Parameter for Illegal Reflective Access

Reflective access is one of the breaking changes of Java 17. If you run your MTF tests with the default Java 11 behavior, the MTF tests log only a warning for reflective access. 

To resemble Java 17 behavior, run your MTF tests with the `--illegal-access=deny` JVM parameter so the MTF tests fail instead of logging only a warning. Use this parameter in Mule runtime versions 4.2.0 and later.

To set up your custom connector’s `pom.xml` file to include the configuration:

. Add an empty property:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mtf.javaopts></mtf.javaopts>
----
. Update the munit-extensions-maven-plugin configuration to include the following configuration:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<environmentVariables>
   <!-- Toggles the JDK17 style flag -->
   <_JAVA_OPTIONS>-XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags ${mtf.javaopts}</_JAVA_OPTIONS>
</environmentVariables>
----

You can now run your MTF tests with the `--illegal-access=deny` parameter. Here is an example bash script: 

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
RUNTIME_VERSION=4.6.0
MUNIT_JVM=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java
mvn clean
mkdir target 
mvn verify \
    -DruntimeProduct=MULE_EE \
    -DruntimeVersion=$RUNTIME_VERSION \
    -Dmunit.jvm=$MUNIT_JVM \
    -Dmtf.javaopts="--illegal-access=deny" > ./target/test.log
----

After running your MTF tests, go to the `target/illegal-access.log` file and check for classes or dependencies that misbehave. 

You can also use the following command to exclude the known warnings outside of your custom connector: 

[source,bash]
----
cat target/illegal-access.log | sort | uniq | grep -Ev "org.mule.module.artifact|org.mule.metadata|org.mule.runtime|org.mule.service"
----

[[test-for-java-17-compatibility-directly]]
==== Test for Java 17 Compatibility Directly

Run your MTF tests to test compatibility of your custom connector against Java 17. 

As mentioned previously, you can use a single build pipeline that runs against all supported Java versions. You can also set up another temporary build pipeline for Java 17 so your main build pipeline doesn't become unstable. After you upgrade to Java 17, discard the temporary build pipeline and converge on your main build pipeline.

. Set the path to your JVM installation in the `MUNIT_JVM` variable (you must install it yourself). You must also set `JAVA_HOME` to Java 8. 
. Ensure the following MTF dependencies are set in your custom connector `pom.xml` file:
+
* munit 3.1.0
* munit-extensions-maven-plugin 1.2.0
* mtf-tools 1.2.0
* mule-maven-plugin 4.1.0
* mule-extensions-maven-plugin 1.6.0-rc1

These MTF dependencies require a minimum Mule version of 4.3.0. To ensure your MTF tests don't validate against Mule runtime versions earlier than 4.3.0, add the following to the `munit-plugin` configuration in your custom connector `pom.xml` file: 

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<configuration>
	[...]
<runtimeConfiguration>
    <discoverRuntimes>
        <minMuleVersion>${minVersion}</minMuleVersion>
        <includeSnapshots>false</includeSnapshots>
        <product>EE</product>
    </discoverRuntimes>
</runtimeConfiguration>
</configuration>
----

You can run MTF tests against Java 17 only with Mule runtime 4.6.0 and later. For Mule runtime 4.5.x and earlier, you can run MTF tests only against Java 8 and Java 11. 

MUnit 3.1 is compatible only with Mule runtime 4.3.0 and later. If your connector is compatible with Mule runtime 4.2.0 and earlier, you must create a legacy profile that overrides the MUnit version.

Use the following bash script to test your custom connector against Java 17: 

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
RUNTIME_VERSION=4.6.0
MUNIT_JVM=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java
mvn clean
mkdir target
mvn verify \
   -DruntimeProduct=MULE_EE \
   -DruntimeVersion=$RUNTIME_VERSION \
   -Dmunit.jvm=$MUNIT_JVM \
   -Dmule.module.tweaking.validation.skip=true \
   -Dmule.jvm.version.extension.enforcement=LOOSE > ./target/test.log
----

=== Read Your Tests 

After you run your MTF tests, your build has either of the following outcomes:

* Test failures
+
You probably need to change your custom connector code to ensure Java 17 compatibility.

* All tests pass
+
Either your custom connector does not require any major changes or your test suite is not comprehensive enough. Review your test suite and double-check that your code coverage is good and that your test scenarios and assertions are not too simple.
