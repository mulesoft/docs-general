[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
| Feature: Description| RAML Implementation | OAS Implementation | REST Connect Support
4+| *Modularity:* The ability to break an API specification into reusable and shared units.
| API Document: The main API specification description metadata, which is the entry point for the specification. | RAML root document | OAS root document | Can Generate a simple connector.
| Libraries: The unit containing collections of related reusable description elements. | RAML library | Can be implemented using an empty OAS specification containing multiple components. | Not applicable
| Fragments: Stand-alone component of the specification that describes a specific element. | RAML fragment | Can be implemented using an empty OAS specification containing a single component.| Not applicable
| Overlays: A partial description of the API specification that you can use to overwrite non-functional aspects of the API specification by composing it with the original specification, for example, translating the documentation to other languages. | RAML overlay | Can be simulated with JSON patch or merge preprocessing. | Connectors can be generated for modified APIs.
| Extensions: A partial description of the API spec that can be used to overwrite non-functional aspects of the API spec composing it with the original specification, like for example adding the security information for a managed API | RAML extension | Can be simulated with JSON patch or merge preprocessing. | Connectors can be generated for modified APIs.
4+| *Reusability:* The ability to reuse the API description in multiple specifications.
| Inline declarations and references: The ability to declare and reference elements from multiple documents. | Inclusion and named references to: datatypes, traits, resource types, and annotations declarations. | JSON reference and OAS components. | Inlines through AMF for connectivity.
| Traits: Macros that extend operations in the functional model, such as pagination, that can be reused in multiple specifications for consistency | Operation macros and RAML traits | Not applicable | Inlines through AMF for connectivity.
| Resource types: Macros that extend resources in the functional model with complex behavior and data definition that can be reused in multiple specifications for consistency | Endpoint macros and RAML resource types | Not applicable | Inlines through AMF for connectivity.
4+| *API Metadata:* Provides metadata about the API that might be used by tooling as required.
| API Entrypoint: The main entry point for the API description, mostly human-readable information, such as title, version, license, and so forth. | RAML document top level information | OAS Open API object| Not applicable
| Server and protocols: Denotes the actual connectivity to the service | RAML base URI information | OAS Server object | Provides the value for the connection.
| Terms of service & licensing: The user agreement and licensing information of the API | Only plain documentation | OAS Info object | Not applicable
| User documentation: Includes user guide and reference material that clarifies how the API works. | RAML description properties in different parts of the specification | OAS description properties in the specification objects | Not applicable
| Localized documentation: Specifies multi-lingual descriptions | Using overlays | Not applicable | Not applicable
| Tags: Classification of parts of the specification | Only use annotations | OAS Tag object | Not applicable
4+| *Functional model:* A declaration of the resources to use when RPCs are invoked.
| Endpoints: Refers to the resources and RPC invocations in the API | Because RAML is more RESTful, the RAML resources are more explicit in its working and allows for the nesting of those resources. | OAS Path Item objects under the Paths object | Provides options for connectivity.
| Methods and bindings to HTTP uniform interface: Includes operations over the resource and information about how to invoke the RPC operation. | Get, Patch, Put, Post, Delete, Options, and head RAML operations | Get, Put, Post, Delete, Options, Head, Patch, Trace and fixed fields under the OAS Path Item object | Provides options for connectivity.
| Input parameters and HTTP bindings: Specifies the input parameters for the operation. | RAML parameters | OAS Parameter object | Provides options for connectivity.
| Responses with multiple media types: Specifies the output parameter for the operation. | RAML responses | OAS Response object | Provides options for connectivity.
| Responses with bindings to HTTP status codes: Specifies the binding to the HTTP status code. | RAML responses | OAS Response object | Provides options for connectivity.
| Callbacks: Specifies the asynchronous invocations and webhooks. | Not applicable | OAS Callback object | Not applicable
| Links: Specifies the static connections between endpoints in the specification, excluding hyperlinks in the data. |  Not applicable | OAS Link object | Not applicable
4+| *Security model:* A declaration of which security mechanisms you can used across the APIs.
| OAuth 1.0: The API authentication requires using OAuth 1.0 as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849[RFC5849]. | RAML security schemes | Not applicable | Not applicable
| OAuth 2.0: The API authentication requires using OAuth 2.0 as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[RFC6749]. | RAML security schemes | OAS Security Scheme object | Supported in connectors.
| Basic: The API authentication relies on using Basic Access Authentication as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617[RFC2617]. | RAML security schemes | OAS Security Scheme object | Supported in connectors.
| Digest: The API authentication relies on using Digest Access Authentication as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617[RFC2617] | RAML security schemes | Not applicable |  Supported in connectors.
| API Key: The API authentication relies on using API key (either as a header, a cookie parameter, or as a query parameter). | Not applicable | OAS Security Scheme object | Not applicable
| Open ID Connect: The API authentication relies on using OAuth2's common flows (implicit, password, client credentials and authorization code) defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-discovery-06[OpenID Connect Discovery]. | Not applicable | OAS Security Scheme object | Not applicable
| Pass through: Headers or query parameters are passed through to the API based on a defined mapping. | RAML security schemes | Not applicable | Supported in connectors.
| Custom: The API authentication relies on another custom authentication method. | RAML security schemes | OAS Security Scheme object | Not applicable
4+| *Data description and validation:* Validation of any XML or JSON instance against inner elements follows the same restrictions as the validation against a regular XML or JSON schema.
| JSON schema constraints and support: The level of support or constraints on JSON schemas. This is the base for both. RAML Types is a superset | RAML JSON support | OAS Schema object | Not applicable
| Schema Inheritance: The combining and extending of model definitions by using properties of JSON Schema.| RAML type inheritance | *Simulated with `$allOf`, not proper inheritance, murky situation in OAS Schema* | Not applicable
| Type expressions: Type expressions can be used wherever a type is expected. Using type expressions, you can devise type unions, arrays, maps, and other things.| RAML type expressions | Not applicable |  Not applicable
| XML Schema constraints and support: The level of support or constraints on XML schemas. | RAML XML support provided indirectly through RAML XML facets for RAML types. | Support provided indirectly through XML properties for the `Schema object` | Not applicable
| Examples: RAML or OAS examples of implementing validations. | RAML examples | OAS `Example object` | Not applicable
| Mandatory valid examples: Required examples that are valid. | Not applicable | Not applicable | Not applicable
4+| *Meta-model extensibility:* Defines the ability to extend the format to describe additional details or objects.
| Custom property extensions: Extensions and additional details for custom properties. | Annotations | OAS specification extensions | Used to customize connectivity details.
| Custom node extensions: Additional details for custom node extensions. | Complex annotations | Not applicable | Not applicable
| Extensions schema: Additional details about extension schemas | Annotations can have a schema and can be validated |Not applicable | Not applicable
| Extensions semantics: Semantics to be used for defining extensions. |  Not applicable | Not applicable | Not applicable
