= Step 3. Develop the API 
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

You've created an API specification, now use it to create an API.

In Anypoint Platform, developers package an API in an application that is deployed to an instance of xref:mule-runtime::index.adoc[Mule runtime engine (Mule)].
Mule is a lightweight integration engine that runs Mule apps. Instances of Mule are embedded in Studio, and in the environments where you will deploy Mule apps and APIs.
These environments are called targets. One target is the Mule embedded in Studio, which you use for
development and testing. Another target, xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub], is managed by MuleSoft and is cloud based.

This tutorial shows you how to deploy first to Mule in Studio. When the API is complete, you'll deploy it to Mule in CloudHub.

. The Package Explorer helps you navigate the files created for each project.
. The canvas is where you drag and drop elements of your project and connect them, creating a flow.
. The Mule Palette provides quick access to standard or custom assets such as connectors and modules.
. The tabs in the bottom section provide access to configuration dialogs, the Mule debugger, and other developer dialogs.

== Step 3.1: Add Your Anypoint Platform Credentials to Studio

Add your Anypoint Platform credentials in Studio once, and they'll be available for all the projects you create.

. Open Studio, and then click *Anypoint Studio > Preferences*.
. Select *Anypoint Studio > Authentication*.
. Enter your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. Optionally, enter a duration in days for how long this authentication is valid.
. Click *Sign in*.
. Click *Apply and Close*.

These credentials are automatically used for many operations in Studio.

== Step 3.2: Create a New Studio Project with an Imported API Specification

In this step, we'll create the project.

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
+
image:new-project-dialog.png[New project dialog]
. In the dialog box, provide the following values:
  ** *Project Name*: `hello-world`
  ** *Runtime*: If there is a choice, select the latest version of Mule. This is the Mule runtime engine that is hosted within Studio for testing.
  ** Select the *Import a published API* tab.
    ... Click the green plus sign, and then select *From Exchange*.
    ... Log in to your organization if needed.
    ... Type `hello-world` in the search box.
    ... Click *hello-world* to select it.
    ... Click *Add* to move it to the *Selected modules* list.
    ... Click *Finish*.
. Scroll down to verify that the checkbox *Scaffold flows from these API specifications* is selected. This ensures that Studio adds default error handling and other helpful items to your project.
. Click *Finish*.
. Studio creates an XML file, `hello-world.xml` and opens it in the canvas *Message Flow* view,
displaying some of the basic elements you'll need for the API interface:

image:my-first-project.png[View in Studio after importing API specification with scaffolding]

If you scroll down the canvas, you can see all the scaffolding that has been added to your API specification
to create an API:

* HTTP Listener is ready to receive requests
* APIkit Router routes messages
* Error handlers for different error conditions
* A console, *hello-world-console*, which we won't use in this tutorial
* The GET request to endpoint `/greeting`, where we will do the bulk of our configuration.

Notice that there are three different views of the canvas:

image:canvas-tabs.png[One canvas and links to all three views, 500]

* *Message Flow* view makes it easy to drag and drop modules, connectors, and other assets and create the relationships between them.
* *Global Elements* view makes it easy to specify global elements used in multiple projects.
* *Configuration XML* view makes it easy to edit the XML of a project directly.

Let's verify the values set in the Listener at the top of your flow in the canvas:

. Double-click Listener to display its general configuration values.
. Click the edit icon next to the configuration name, and verify that the host is `0.0.0.0` and the port is `8081`.
. Click *Test Connection*, and then click *OK* when a successful test connection is reported.
. Click *OK* to close the configuration. This leaves you in the *Global Elements* tab.
. Click *Message Flow* to return to the previous tab. General configuration values for Listener should still be displayed.
. Verify that *Path* is set as */api/**. This best practice ensures that all endpoints will be of the form `base-URI/api/endpoint`.

In the next step, we'll create business logic and configure the elements we need for this API.

== Step 3.3: Configure the API

Using the scaffolding provided by Studio, complete the API by configuring the `/greeting` endpoint module:

. In *Message Flow* tab of the canvas, scroll down until you see the `/greeting` endpoint module:
+
image:greeting-module.png[View of GET connector as created by scaffolding, 500]
. Right-click the *Transform Message* and delete it.
. In *Mule Palette*, select *Favorites* to display a list of core connectors.
. Click *Set Payload* to select it, and then drag it into the space where you deleted Transform Message, to the right of the area labeled *Source*.
. Specify the logic that displays the data sent in a response from hello-world API:
  .. Click the Set Payload transformer you just added to the flow.
+
image:set-payload.png[View of canvas and configuration dialog for Set Payload connector, 500]
  .. Below the canvas, in the *General* tab, click the *fx* (function) button to deselect it. For this tutorial, we are hard-coding the value.
  .. Set *Value* under *Settings* to `Today the greeting is Hello.`
. Save your work by selecting *File > Save All*.
. Click *Configuration XML* at the bottom of the canvas to review the XML generated by your work.
. Click *Message Flow* to set the canvas for the next step.

You have created a project that contains a simple Mule app which you can deploy to expose your API.

[NOTE]
====
This API has been simplified compared to a typical production-ready API:

* The payload (what's delivered by the GET request) is hard coded in the project configuration. In a production-ready API the payload value would typically come from another source or be the function of a variable or DataWeave formula.
* The best practice of separating the interface and implementation (business logic) into separate XML files has been skipped for the sake of brevity.
====

== Step 3.4. Test the API

Run the Studio project that contains your API in the Mule runtime engine and then test with a third-party client:

. Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select *Run project hello-world*.
+
The console opens and displays status messages as the app is deployed to the Mule runtime engine (Mule) contained within Studio.
When the following message is displayed, the app containing your API has been deployed to Mule:
+
----
*******************************************************************************************************
*            - - + APPLICATION + - -            *       - - + DOMAIN + - -       * - - + STATUS + - - *
*******************************************************************************************************
* hello-world                                   * default                        * DEPLOYED           *
*******************************************************************************************************
----
. To test the app, open a REST client (Advanced Rest Client) and issue a GET request:
+
`\http://localhost:8081/api/greeting`
+
Your REST client should return a `200 OK` message and the body `Today the greeting is Hello.`.
. Right-click in the canvas and select *Stop project hello-word*.

== Step 3.5. Create a Business Group in Your Organization

Before you can publish your API to Exchange to share it with others, you must create a Business Group in your trial organization.
Assets in Exchange must belong to a Business Group that is not the master Business Group.

If you've already created a business group in your organization, you can skip this step.

To create a Business Group:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
+
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signup["Take me to Anypoint Platform^", role="button-primary"]
. Find *Management Center* on the landing page and underneath it, click *Access Management*.
. Click *Add Business Group* and enter these values:
  ** *Business Group name*: `My Top Business Group`
  ** *Owner*: Search for your name and select it.
  ** Select *Owner can create environment*.
  ** Leave the default for all other values.
. Click *Add Business Group*.

Your new business group is listed underneath the organization name in the Access Management screen.

== Step 3.6. Publish the API to Exchange

Publish the API to Exchange so it can serve as a template or example for others.

. From the Package Explorer in Studio, right-click the `hello-world` project.
. Select *Anypoint Platform > Publish to Exchange*.
+
image:pub-to-exchange.png[Dialog to publish API to Exchange]

. Enter values for your project:
  ** For *User*, select your username.
  ** For *Business group*, select the business group you created, *My Top Business Group*. You can't use the master business group, which appears by default in this field. If your credentials have expired, click *Add account* to add them again.
  ** Leave *Version* with the default value.
  ** Select *Project type > Example*. The *Finish* button is now enabled.
. Click *Next*.
. You can add documentation, descriptions, and tags that aid search.
. Click *Finish*.
. Click *Yes* when asked to proceed.
+
After the project is uploaded to Exchange, you are provided with a direct link to the project.
+
image:link-to-published-api.png[Dialog showing link to API published in Exchange, 600] 
. Click the link to view the project in Exchange.
+
image:published-in-exchange.png[API viewed from Exchange]

. Notice that HTTP Connector and Sockets Connector are listed as dependencies, which is viewed by clicking *Version detail* from the dropdown menu in the *Asset versions* section.
. When you are satisfied with the publication, return to Studio and click *OK* to close the open dialog windows.

== What's Next

To finish developing the API, you will add:

* Validation
* Event logging to support debugging
* Error handling
* A unit test to your API

We'll publish the updated version after it is complete.
