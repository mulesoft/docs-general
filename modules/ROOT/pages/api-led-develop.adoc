= Step 3. Develop the API 
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Now that you've created an API specification, use it to create a Mule app.

In Anypoint Platform, developers package an API in an application that is deployed to an instance of xref:mule-runtime::index.adoc[Mule runtime engine (Mule)].
Mule is a lightweight integration engine that runs Mule apps. Instances of Mule are embedded in Studio, and in the environments where you deploy Mule apps and APIs.
These environments are called targets. One target is the Mule embedded in Studio, which you use for
development and testing. Another target, xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub], is managed by MuleSoft and is cloud based.

First, you'll deploy the app to Mule in Studio and then, you'll deploy it to Mule in CloudHub.

. Package Explorer helps you navigate the files created for each project.
. The canvas is where you drag elements of your project and connect them, creating a flow.
. The Mule Palette provides quick access to standard or custom assets such as connectors and modules.
. The tabs in the configuration section provide access to configuration dialogs, the Mule debugger, and other developer dialogs.

== Step 3.1: Add Your Anypoint Platform Credentials to Studio

Add your Anypoint Platform credentials in Studio once, and they'll be available for all the future projects you create.

. Open Studio, and then select *Anypoint Studio > Settings*.
. In the Preferences window, click *Anypoint Studio*, and then *Authentication*.
. Click *Add* and enter your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. Click *Sign in*. 
. Optionally, click *Yes* in the *Secure Storage - Password Hint Needed* dialog. 
. Click *Apply and Close*.

These credentials are automatically used for many operations in Studio.

== Step 3.2: Create a New Studio Project with an Imported API Specification

In this step, you create the project.

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
+
image:new-project-dialog.png[New project dialog]
. In the dialog box, provide the following values:
  ** *Project Name*: `hello-world-app`
  ** *Runtime*: If there is a choice, select the latest version of Mule. This is the Mule runtime engine that is hosted within Studio for testing.
  ** Select the *Import a published API* tab.
    ... Click the green plus sign, and then select *From Exchange*.
    ... Log in to your organization if needed.
    ... Type `hello-world` in the search box.
    ... Click *hello-world-api* to select it.
    ... Click *Add* to move it to the *Selected modules* list, and then click *Finish*.
. Verify that the checkbox *Scaffold flows from these API specifications* is selected, and click *Finish*. 
+
This setting ensures that Studio adds default error handling and other helpful items to your project

Studio creates a `hello-world.xml` XML file and opens it in the canvas *Message Flow* view, showing the basic elements you need for the API interface:

image:my-first-project.png[View in Studio after importing API specification with scaffolding]

Scroll down the canvas to see the scaffolding that was added to your app:

* HTTP Listener is ready to receive requests
* APIkit Router routes messages
* Error handlers for different error conditions
* A console, *hello-world-app-console*, which you won't use for this project
* The GET request to endpoint `/greeting`, where you do the bulk of your configuration

There are three different views of the canvas:

image:canvas-tabs.png[One canvas and links to all three views, 500]

* Use *Message Flow* to drag modules, connectors, and other assets on to the canvas and create the relationships between them.
* Use *Global Elements* to specify global elements used in multiple projects.
* Use the *Configuration XML* to directly edit the XML of a project.

Verify the values set in the *Listener* component in the canvas:

. Double-click *Listener* to display its general configuration values.
. Click the edit icon image:edit-module-version-icon.png[Pencil on notebook] next to the configuration name, and verify that the host is `0.0.0.0` and the port is `8081`.
. Click *Test Connection*, and then click *OK* when a successful test connection is reported.
. Click *OK* to close the configuration.
+
You return to the *Global Configuration Elements* tab.
. Click *Message Flow* to return to the canvas.
+
The general configuration values for the Listener component are still displayed.
. Verify that *Path* is set as */api/**. This best practice ensures that all endpoints are formed like `base-URI/api/endpoint`.

In the next step, you create business logic and configure the elements you need for this API.

== Step 3.3: Configure the API

Using the scaffolding provided by Studio, complete the app by configuring the `/greeting` endpoint module:

. In the *Message Flow* view, scroll down the canvas until you see the `/greeting` endpoint module:
+
image:greeting-module.png[View of GET connector as created by scaffolding, 500]
. Right-click the *Transform Message* component and delete it.
. In *Mule Palette*, select *Favorites* to display a list of components, services, transformers, and routers.
. Click *Set Payload* to select it, and then drag it into the *Process* space, where you deleted Transform Message.
. Specify the logic that displays the data sent in a response from the hello-world-api API:
  .. Click the *Set Payload* transformer you just added to the flow.
+
image:set-payload.png[View of canvas and configuration dialog for Set Payload connector, 500]
  .. In the *General* tab, click the *fx* (function) button to deselect it. For this tutorial, you are hard-coding the value.
  .. In *Settings*, set the *Value* to `Today the greeting is Hello.`
. In the Anypoint Studio menu, select *File > Save All*.
. Click the *Configuration XML* tab on the canvas to review the XML generated by your work.
. Click *Message Flow* to set the canvas for the next step.

You now have a project that contains a simple Mule app that you can deploy to expose your API.

[NOTE]
====
This API has been simplified compared to a typical production-ready API:

* The payload (what's delivered by the GET request) is hard coded in the project configuration. In a production-ready API the payload value would typically come from another source or be the function of a variable or DataWeave formula.
* The best practice of separating the interface and implementation (business logic) into separate XML files is skipped in this tutorial for conciseness.
====

== Step 3.4. Test the API

Run the Studio project that contains your API in the Mule runtime engine (Mule) and then test it with a third-party client:

. Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select *Run project hello-world-app*.
+
The console opens within Studio and displays status messages as the app is deployed to Mule.
The following message displays when the app containing your API is deployed to Mule:
+
----
*******************************************************************************************************
*            - - + APPLICATION + - -            *       - - + DOMAIN + - -       * - - + STATUS + - - *
*******************************************************************************************************
* hello-world-app                                  * default                        * DEPLOYED           *
*******************************************************************************************************
----
. To test the app, open a REST client (Advanced Rest Client) and issue a GET request:
+
`\http://localhost:8081/api/greeting`
+
Your REST client returns a `200 OK` message and the body `Today the greeting is Hello`.
. Right-click in the canvas and select *Stop project hello-word-app*.

== Step 3.5. Create a Business Group in Your Organization

Before you can publish your app to Exchange to share it with others, you must create a Business Group in your trial organization.
Assets in Exchange must belong to a Business Group that is not the root Business Group.

If you've already created a business group in your organization, you can skip this step.

To create a Business Group:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
+
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signup["Take me to Anypoint Platform^", role="button-primary"]
. Find *Management Center* on the landing page and click *Access Management*.
. In the navigation panel, click *Business Groups*.
. Click *Create business group* and enter `My Top Business Group` in *Name*. 
. Select a business group you are the administrator for from the *Parent business group* dropdown.
. In *Owner*, enter your user name and select it when it is found. 
. Select the *Can create environments* checkbox, and click *Create*.

Your new business group is listed underneath the organization name in the Access Management screen.

== Step 3.6. Publish the API to Exchange

Publish the API to Exchange so it can serve as a template or example for others.

. In Studio, from Package Explorer, right-click the `hello-world-app` project.
. Select *Anypoint Platform > Publish to Exchange*.
+
image:pub-to-exchange.png[Dialog to publish API to Exchange]

. Enter values for your project:
  ** For *User*, select your username.
  ** For *Business group*, select the *My Top Business Group* business group you created. You can't use the root business group, which appears by default in this field. If your credentials expired, click *Add account* to add them again.
  ** Leave *Version* with the default value.
  ** Select *Project type > Example*. 
. Click *Next*.
. You can add documentation, descriptions, and tags that aid users in searching Exchange for available assets.
. Click *Finish*.
. Click *Yes* when asked to proceed.
+
After the project is uploaded to Exchange, you are provided with a direct link to the project.
+
image:link-to-published-api.png[Dialog showing link to API published in Exchange, 600] 
. Click the link to view the project in Exchange:
+
image:api-led-assets-list-arrow.png[Home page of the hello-world-app you deployed]
+
. Click *Back to Assets List*. 
+
You can now see the Exchange tile for the asset you just published. 
. (Optional) Sign out of Exchange and search for the asset you just created. 
  .. Click the tile for your *hello-world-app*. 
  .. In the *Asset Versions* section, click the more (...) menu and select *Version detail*. The HTTP Connector, Sockets Connector, and APIKit module are listed as dependencies.
  +
  image:published-in-exchange.png[Version details of app page as viewed in Exchange]
. After you explore the published asset on Exchange, return to Studio and click *OK* to close the open dialog windows.

== What's Next

To finish developing the API, next you will add:

* Validation
* Event logging to support debugging
* Error handling
* A unit test to your API

You will publish the updated version of the app after it is complete.
