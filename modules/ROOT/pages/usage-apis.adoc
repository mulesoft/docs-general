You can access metering data for Anypoint Platform using the xref:usage-reports.adoc[usage reports feature] or API calls.

The following APIs enable you to access and examine your metering data:

* The Metering API enables you to access your usage data stored in the MuleSoft metering service. You can also use the Anypoint Monitoring Query Language (AMQL) to search your data.
* The Describe API enables you to understand the full scope of data that the Mulesoft Metering Service retains.
