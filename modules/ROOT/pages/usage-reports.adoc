= Viewing Usage Reports
:page-aliases: gateway::flex-view-usage-reports.adoc

Usage reports provide comprehensive monthly and daily usage reports that provide valuable insights into your resource consumption across Anypoint Platform products. Usage reports enable you to track and understand your usage patterns, which helps you optimize your resource allocation. By correlating your usage patterns with billing cycles, you can gain insights into the factors influencing your costs, which enables you to proactively manage your budget and make informed decisions to optimize your resource allocation.

When you use an Anypoint Platform product, MuleSoft meters your usage and aggregates the records on a daily and monthly basis. Currently, some products have only monthly usage reports available. Usage reports are updated on the third day of each month and are split by product. All reports are calculated using the UTC time standard.

Metrics and data availability in usage reports are also influenced by your pricing and packaging model. For more information about usage metrics and pricing, read the following:

* xref:pricing.adoc[]
* xref:pricing-metrics.adoc[]

== Access Usage Reports

Usage reports are available only when accessing the root organization and do not appear at the business group level.

To access usage reports, you need the xref:access-management::permissions-by-product.adoc#usage[Usage Viewer permission]. If you don't have this permission, contact your organization administrator to request access. The Usage Viewer permission must be xref:access-management::managing-permissions.adoc[applied at the root organization level] rather than the business group level.

== Usage Reports Availability

When you navigate to the *Usage Reports* page in Anypoint Plaform, the selection of products you see varies based on the view you are using. Products that have usage reports only on a monthly basis are viewable only in the legacy usage reports view, while products that have both daily and monthly usage reports are available only in the new usage reports view. To switch between views, click the *Switch View* button in the banner. 

The following products have both daily and monthly usage reports:

* <<mule-runtime>>
* <<flex-gateway>>
* <<api-experience-hub>>

The following products have only monthly usage reports:

* <<api-manager>>
* <<api-govern>>

[[flex-gateway]]
=== Flex Gateway

Flex Gateway usage reports track daily and monthly API calls. You can view API calls by business group, environment, and registration.

To calculate usage, MuleSoft meters the hourly API calls you make and aggregates the number of API calls on a daily and monthly basis. 
 
[[api-govern]]
=== API Governance

API Governance usage reports track the maximum number of xref:api-governance::index.adoc#governed-apis[APIs governed] in a given month per business group. 

To calculate usage, MuleSoft tracks the number of governed APIs each business group uses per hour and then identifies the maximum number of APIs governed in a month for each business group. To calculate the total count for API Governance, MuleSoft adds the maximum number of governed APIs per month used across all business groups. 

Note that the number of governed APIs (both conformant and non-conformant) shown in the API governance console represents a current snapshot of your usage per business group, while the usage report shows the maximum number of APIs you used in a given month per business group.

[[api-manager]]
=== API Manager

API Manager usage reports track the maximum number of xref:api-manager::latest-overview-concept.adoc#api-instances[API instances] deployed in a given month per business group, environment, and runtime. 

To calculate usage, MuleSoft tracks the number of managed API instances each business group, environment, and runtime uses per hour and identifies the maximum number of managed API instances used in a month for each business group, environment, and runtime. To calculate the total count for API Manager, MuleSoft adds the maximum number of managed API instances per month used across business groups, environments, and runtimes.

[[api-experience-hub]]
=== API Experience Hub

API Experience Hub usage reports track the number of approved access requests on a daily and monthly basis by Salesforce org ID and Salesforce portal name. 

// need information about data aggregation

[[mule-runtime]]
=== Mule Runtime

Mule runtime reports track your use of Mule messages, Mule flows, and data throughput. 

To track Mule message usage, the runtime report counts the number of times a Mule event source triggers a Mule message. You can view the number of these messages in a given day or month by business group, environment, and application. 

To calculate usage, MuleSoft meters and aggregates the number of messages on a daily and monthly basis. After a message is triggered, the report does not track changes to the message because the message is processed within the applicationâ€™s flows.

A Mule flow is a sequence of logical operations configured within the XML `<flow/>` element of a Mule application. The runtime report tracks the Mule flows within a deployed and running Mule application that contains a Mule event source or APIkit route requests. This report does not track other Mule flows. You can view the maximum number of Mule flows in a given day or month in the usage report. 

To calculate usage, MuleSoft tracks the number of Mule flows for all business groups, environments, and applications. The maximum number of Mule flows within a day or month is identified based on the peak hour across the day or month. For the detailed breakdown, MuleSoft shows the peak hour usage per business group, environment, and application. 

Data throughput is all the network I/O bytes produced by the infrastructure that starts and runs the Mule runtime engine that runs a Mule application. You can view the total amount of GB usage in a given day or month by business group, environment, and application. 

To calculate usage, MuleSoft tracks GB usage and aggregates the total GBs on a daily and monthly basis.

==== Supported Mule Runtime Versions

To view usage reports for Mule runtime, all of your relevant applications (in production and sandbox) must use the following Mule versions:

[cols="2*"]
|===
|Deployment Type |Version Requirements

|CloudHub 2.0
|The latest date-patch versions for 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5

|CloudHub 1.0
|The latest date-patch versions for 3.9, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5

|Runtime Fabric
a| One of the following versions or any later date-patch:

Mule 4 image versions:

* 4.5.0:23e
* 4.4.0-20230111-1
* 4.3.0-20221212-2
* 4.2.2-20221027-7
* 4.2.1-20221027-7
* 4.2.0-20221027-6

Mule 3 image versions:

* 3.9.5-20230424-2
* 3.9.4-20230424-1
* 3.9.3-20230424-1
* 3.9.2-20230424-1
* 3.9.1-20230424-1

|=== 

You must redeploy your apps with a supported version, either manually or during the monthly patching cycle. The monthly patching cycle is applicable only for CloudHub 1.0 and CloudHub 2.0 applications. Runtime Fabric customers must be using Runtime Fabric agent version 1.13.112 or 2.1.30 or later. If usage reports do not appear properly, you must also manually redeploy Runtime Fabric applications (with a supported date-patch version).

If you want to xref:cloudhub-2::ch2-update-apps.adoc#roll-back-to-a-previous-successful-configuration[roll back] to a previous successful configuration of existing applications that use a Mule version that usage reports do not support, you must choose a compliant version before deploying changes. After deployment, a new configuration with the previously chosen settings and a supported runtime is created.

==== Runtime Fabric Apps in Usage Reports

If usage reports do not display data from Runtime Fabric apps, ensure the following requirements are met:

* You are using Runtime Fabric agent version 1.13.112, 2.1.30, or later. 
* After updating the Runtime Fabric agent, you have manually redeployed each Runtime Fabric app with a supported date-patch version.

If you are still missing Runtime Fabric apps in your usage reports, contact your account executive to request a report of apps that are not upgraded and what actions need to be taken to update them.
