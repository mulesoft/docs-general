= Step 2. Design an API Specification
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

To design an API, assess the purpose and requirements:

* Identify the type of API. Is it a simple API, part of an integration, or part of a back-end system?
* Understand the data flows: one-way, two-way, or more.
* Explore the security requirements.

After you define the scope and flow of your integration project,
define an API specification in RAML (or import to RAML from OAS).
Then, in later steps, you'll use the API specification to quickly develop an API.  

== API Specifications and APIs

An API is a published interface to a resource that anyone with the correct permissions
and a properly structured request can access. 

An API specification details the functional and expected behavior of an API, 
as well as the fundamental design philosophy and supported data types.
It contains both documentation and API definitions 
to create a contract that people and software can read. 

MuleSoft provides tools that make it easy to create an API specification that you can then share with your team, your customers, or the general public.
Using an API specification increases adoption and shortens project completion time. 

== Step 1: Explore Existing API Specifications

If you look at existing API specifications before writing your own,
you can learn how other people have approached situations similar to yours.
You can also check whether an API specification with the same objectives is not already in development, and reuse it if appropriate.

Looking for an API specification that already does what you need is easy:

* Look at the public Exchange. You’ll see some of the most popular API specifications, connectors, and other assets displayed.
+
link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange["Take me there^", role="button-primary"]
+
  .. Click *Discover and share* under *Exchange*.
  .. Select *All Types > REST APIs* (next to the search bar) to display only REST API specifications.
  .. Click on any specification to see the data types and the HTTP requests defined for the API. 
+
* Look at Exchange for your organization (account). Logging in changes the view to your organization's private Exchange.
+
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login["Take me to Anypoint Platform^", role="button-primary"] 
+
  .. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
  .. Click *Discover and share* under *Exchange*. 
  .. Click on any specification to see the data types and the HTTP requests defined for the API.


After exploring Exchange, return to Anypoint Platform to create a new API specification that defines what our tutorial API can do.

== Step 2: Create Your API Specification

Create your own API specification for a simple Hello World API that responds to a simple GET request:

. Open the Design Center to the API Designer:
+
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/designer/["Take me to API Designer^", role="button-primary"]
. Click *Create* to open the API Designer editor.
. Click *Create API specification*.
. Enter `hello-world` for *Name* and don't change the other default values.
. Click *Create Specification*. The API Designer editor displays a sample RAML definition.
. Replace all the text with RAML that specifies the API:

[source,raml]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: hello, world
version: v1
description: A greeting for the world

types:
 greeting: 
   properties:
     todays-greeting: string

/greeting:
     get: 
       responses: 
         200:
           body:
             application/json:
               type: greeting
               example:
                 {todays-greeting: "test-greeting"}
         404: 
           body:
             application/json:
               properties:
                 message: string
               example: |
                 {
                   "message" : "Greeting not found"
                 }
----
This API contains:
* A single HTTP request, GET
* A single data type, `greeting`, with a single property, `todays-greeting` and a sample value
* An HTTP success response
* An HTTP error response

== Step 3: Test Your API Specification

The API specification `hello-world.raml` is complete. Now test it by sending a request.
The mocking service creates a functioning endpoint from your API specification
and provides a simple UI for managing authentication, request headers, and response headers.

To test the API specification:

. Open `hello-world.raml` if it isn't already open:
+
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/#/projects["Take me to API Designer^" role="button-primary"]
+
image:api-spec1.png[]
+
. Click the X next to *Mocking service* to enable it. 
+
image:mocking-service.png[]
+
If you see a checkmark instead of an X, the mocking service is already enabled.
. Look for the label *API endpoints*. You can see the endpoint you defined. HTTP requests appear in green boxes.
+
image:get-button.png[]
. Click *GET* to display the GET request and more information about the specification.
+
image:code-response1.png[]
. Click *Code examples* to review samples for each protocol.
. Click *200* and *404* under *Responses* to review the responses defined in the API specification.
. Click the blue *Try it* button.
+
image:send-me.png[]
. Click *Send* to send your request to the temporary request URL that the mocking service creates from your specification.
+
image:successful-test1.png[]
. Click *Details* to examine the response headers and request headers in the mocking service to help diagnose issues or understand the behavior of your API specification.
. When you have finished testing, click the mocking service checkmark to exit.
image:ignore-me.png[]
+
It's safe to ignore any error messages on this screen.

== Step 4. Publish Your API Specification

After you have tested your API, publish it to your private Exchange so others in your organization can reuse your work.

. Open `hello-world.raml` if it isn't already open:
+
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/#/projects["Take me to API Designer^" role="button-primary"]
. Click *Publish*. 
. Click *Publish to Exchange*.
+
image:publish-to-exchange1.png[]
. Accept all the default values, and verify that you see the message *Valid Specification*.
. Click *Publish*, and then *Done*.

After publication, anyone in your organization can see the hello-world API specification and reuse it.

== What’s Next

Now that you have designed an API and created an API specification for it, 
use Anypoint Studio (Studio) to create a Mule app that contains the implementation and interface for the API.

== Developer Deep Dives

If you're curious about the details, dive right in.

=== Deep Dive: Exchange

You can publish assets to the public Exchange, your internal Exchange, or your public developer portal.

* In addition to the public Exchange, you can review your own organization’s internal offerings.
+
link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/["Take me to Exchange^", role="button-primary"]
+
* If you've created a public developer portal, you can look there as well; click *Public portal*.

=== Deep Dive: API Features

In a typical API project, you’d likely want to do a few more things:

* Add xref:studio::set-credentials-in-studio-to.adoc[authentication].
* Add annotations.
