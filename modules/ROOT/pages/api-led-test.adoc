= Step 4. Add Validation and Error Handling
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

So far, you've created an API and tested the HTTP request with a third-party client, and then published the API to Exchange.
Now you'll use Studio to add validation and a unit test. In Studio, you'll use the scaffolding that's already created to:

* Validate input using the Validation module.
* Create an error handler for one error condition.

== Step 4.1: Validation

Add an operation from the Validation module to the API implementation to ensure that user input is appropriate for the API.
Your API is very simple, so your testing is also simple. You'll test whether the size of the payload is within an acceptable range.

Add the *Validate size* operation to the `hello-world-app` project:

. In the `hello-world-app` project in Studio, open `hello-world-api.xml` if it isn't already open, and make sure you are viewing the *Message Flow* tab of the canvas.
. In *Mule Palette*, select *Add Modules > Validation* and drag it to the *Mule Palette*.
+

. From the list of operations, drag *Validate size* to the Studio canvas and drop it inside the endpoint module to the right of *Set Payload*.
+
image:validate-size.png[Validate size dropped into GET module]
. Click *Validate size* to display the *General* configuration tab.
+
image:configure-validate.png[Validate size configuration tab]
. Set these values in the *General* tab:
  .. *Value*: Click the *fx* button to change from literal mode to expression mode, and then enter `payload` after the characters in the text box. Notice the closing bracket is supplied for you.
  .. *Min*: `6`
  .. *Max*: `30`
  .. *Error options > Message*: `The specified message is either too long or too short.`
. From the Studio main menu, select *File > Save All* to save your changes.
. Right-click in the canvas and select *Run project hello-world-app*.
. After you see the console message indicating `hello-world-app` is deployed, send a request using Advanced Rest Client or a similar tool:
+
[source, xml]
----
http://localhost:8081/api/greeting
----
+
Your request client reports response headers containing `200 OK` and `Today the greeting is Hello.`. This demonstrates the expected behavior when the greeting is within the limits you set in the *Validate size* operation.

. Right-click the canvas and select *Stop project hello-world-app*.

To test that the validation works when the payload is too short, use the debugger to step through each event before the error is triggered.

. In the `hello-world-app` project in Studio, open `hello-world-api.xml`.
. Click *Set Payload*, and then change the value to `Hi.`.
. In *Mule Palette*, select *Favorites > Logger*, and then drag the logger between *Set Payload* and *Validate size*. The logger stops the process to help debugging. No configuration of the logger is needed.
. Right-click *Set Payload* and select *Add breakpoint*.
. Repeat the previous step for *Logger* and *Validate size*.
. Right-click the canvas and select *Debug project hello-world-app*. If prompted to open the Mule Debug perspective, select the *Remember my decision* checkbox and click *Yes*.
+

. In Advanced REST Client, send a request to the `/greeting` endpoint:
+
[source, xml]
----
http://localhost:8081/api/greeting
----

. Return to Studio and notice that there's a dashed line around *Set Payload*.
. In the canvas, click *Set Payload* to open the *Set Payload* node in the *Mule Debugger*. 
. Open *Set Payload* and see that the payload value is `Hi.`, three characters.
. Click the *Next processor* (curved yellow arrow) above the debugger window.
+
image:next-toggle.png[Next processor control to move to next toggle point, 500]
+
If you hover over it to ensure you have the correct control, the label *Next processor (F6)* appears. The debugger pane now shows the Logger connector.
. Click the curved yellow arrow again to move to the *Validate size* operation.
. Click the curved yellow arrow again, and notice that an error message you defined is now in the *error* object in the debugger pane, and a dotted-line shows in the *Validate size* operation.
+
image:validation-error.png[View of debugger displaying error for Validate size, 500]
. Click the *Next processor* again, and notice that the canvas now displays the beginning of your message flow, with a red dotted-line around the APIkit Router, one of the scaffolding items added during import. The router handles the error.
. Click the *Next processor* again to complete the flow. The Mule debugger pane is now empty because the process is complete.
. Look at Advanced Rest Client. You should see `500 Server Error` and the payload value.
+
To see the error you defined returned instead of the payload, you'll need to configure one of the error handlers.
. Right-click on the canvas and select *Stop project hello-world-app*.
. Select *Window > Perspective > Open Perspective > Mule Design* to exit the debugger view.

== Step 4.2: Add Error Handling

Now you'll add an error handler for the validation you've set up.

. In Studio *Mule Palette*, select *Core > On Error Propagate*, and then drag the error handler on to *Error handling* in *get:\greeting:hello-world-app-config*.
+
image:on-error.png[Adding an error handler to GET module and configuring it]
. In the *General* configuration tab, configure the error handler:
  ** *Display Name:* `On Error Propagate`
  ** *Type:* Click the search icon and select *VALIDATION:INVALID_SIZE*.
  ** Don't change the other default values.
. Drag a *Set Payload* operation into the new *On Error Propagate* error handler.
. Configure the new Set Payload operation:
  .. Double-click *Set Payload* to open the *General* tab.
  .. In *Settings > Value:*, replace `payload` with `error.description`.
. Click *File > Save All* to save your changes.
. Add breakpoints to *Set Payload*, *Logger*, and *Validate size* if you previously removed them.
. Right-click in the canvas and select *Debug project hello-world-app*.
. After the app is deployed, send the query `\http://localhost:8081/api/greeting` from Advanced Rest Client, and step through each breakpoint using the curved yellow arrow.
. When you reach *Set Payload* in *On Error Propagate*, you can see that the payload is set to the error message you created in *Validate size*.
+
image:payload-message.png[Debugger messages for Set Payload in error handler]
. When you reach the *APIkit Router* in the message flow, you see that the error message replaces the original payload `Hi.`.
+
image:payload-response.png[Breakpoint at APIkit Router showing error message in payload]
. After you step through and look at the response in Advanced Rest Client, you see that a *500 Server Error* is returned along with the error message.
. Set the original payload back to `Today the greeting is Hello.`.
. Set the view in Studio to *Window > Perspective > Open Perspective > Mule Design*.

Next, you'll publish the revised app.

== Step 4.3: Publish Your Revised App

Make your improved API available on Exchange:

. From *Package Explorer* in Studio, right-click the `hello-world-app` project.
. Select *Anypoint Platform > Publish to Exchange*.
. Be sure to select the same Business Group as you did before. The *Next* button won't be active until you select a valid business group.
. Accept the version number, which automatically increments for you.
. In *Project type*, select *Example*.
. Click *Next*.
. Click *Finish*.


Studio shows you the direct link to your newly published API version. You can copy it to share with others.
