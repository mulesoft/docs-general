= Step 4. Add Validation and Error Handling

So far, we've created an API and tested the HTTP request with a third-party client, and then published the API to Exchange.
Now we'll use Studio to add validation and a unit test. In Studio, we'll use the scaffolding already created to:

* Validate input using the Validation module.
* Create an error handler for one error condition. 

== Step 4.1: Validation

Add an operation from the Validation module to the API implementation to ensure that user input is appropriate for the API.
Our API is very simple, so our testing will be simple. We'll test that the size of the payload is within an acceptable range.

Add the *Validate size* operation to the `hello-world` project:

. In the `hello-world` project in Studio, open `hello-world.xml` if it isn't already open, and make sure you are viewing the *Message Flow* tab of the canvas.
. In *Mule Palette*, select *Add Modules > Validation* and drag it to the drag and drop area in the left side of Mule Palette. 
+

. From the list of operations displayed, drag *Validate size* to the canvas and drop it to the right of *Set Payload*, inside the endpoint module.
+
image:validate-size.png[Validate size dropped into GET module]
. Click *Validate size* to display the *General* configuration tab.
+
image:configure-validate.png[Validate size configuration tab]
. Set these values in the *General* tab:
  .. *Value*: Click the *fx* button to change from literal mode to expression mode, and then enter `payload` after the characters in the text box. Notice the closing bracket is supplied for you.
  .. *Min*: `6`
  .. *Max*: `30`
  .. *Error options > Message*: `The specified message is either too long or too short.`
. From the Studio main menu, select *File > Save All* to save your changes.
. Right-click in the canvas and select *Run project hello-world*.
. After you see the console message indicating `hello-world` has deployed, send a request using Advanced Rest Client or similar:
+
[source, xml]
----
http://localhost:8081/api/greeting
----
+
Your request client should report response headers containing `200 OK` and `Today the greeting is Hello.`. This demonstrates the expected behavior when the greeting is within the limits we just set in the Validate size connector.

. Right-click the canvas and select *Stop project hello-world*.

To test that the validation works when the payload is too short, use the debugger to step through each event before the error is triggered.

. In the `hello-world` project in Studio, open `hello-world.xml`.
. Click *Set Payload*, and then change the value to `Hi.`.
. In *Mule Palette*, select *Favorites > Logger*, and then drag and drop the logger in between *Set Payload* and *Validate size*. The logger will help us stop the process to help debugging. No configuration of the logger is needed.
. Right-click *Set Payload* and select *Toggle breakpoint*.
. Right-click *Logger* and select *Toggle breakpoint*.
. Right-click *Validate size* and select *Toggle breakpoint*.
. Right-click the canvas and select *Debug project hello-world*. If you are asked to open the Mule Debug perspective, select the *Remember my decision* checkbox and click *Yes*.
+

. In Advanced REST Client, send a request to the `/greeting` endpoint:
+
[source, xml]
---- 
http://localhost:8081/api/greeting
----

. Return to Studio and notice that there's a dashed line around *Set Payload*.
. In the canvas, click *Set Payload* to open the *Set Payload* node in the *Mule Debugger* above the canvas. Open *Set Payload* and see that the payload value is `Hi.`, three characters.
. Click the curved yellow arrow above the debugger window. 
+
image:next-toggle.png[Control to move to next toggle point]
+
If you hover over it to ensure you have the right control, the label *Next processor (F6)* appears. The debugger pane now shows the Logger connector.
. Click the curved yellow arrow again to move to the Validate size connector. 
. Click the curved yellow arrow again, and notice that that an error message you defined is now in the *error* object in the debugger pane, and a red dotted-line shows in the Validate size connector.
+
image:validation-error.png[View of debugger displaying error for Validate size]
. Click the curved yellow arrow again, and notice that the canvas now displays the top of your message flow, with a red dotted-line around the APIkit Router, one of the scaffolding items added during import. The router handles the error.
. Click the curved yellow arrow again to complete the flow. Notice that the Mule debugger pane is now empty because the process has completed.   
. Look at Advanced Rest Client. You should see `500 Server Error` and the payload value.
+
To see the error we defined returned instead of the payload, we'll need to configure one of the error handlers.
. Right-click on the canvas and select *Stop project hello-world*.
. Select *Window > Perspective > Open Perspective > Mule Design* to exit the debugger view.

== Step 4.2: Error Handling

Now we'll add an error handler for the validation we've set up.

. In Studio *Mule Palette*, select *Core > On Error Propagate*, and then drag and drop the error handler on *Error handling* in *get:\greeting:hello-world-config*.
+
image:on-error.png[Adding an error handler to GET module and configuring it]
. In the *General* tab below the canvas, configure the error handler:
  ** *Display Name:* `On Error Propagate`
  ** *Settings Type:* Click the search icon and select *VALIDATION:INVALID_SIZE* from the drop-down menu.
  ** Don't change the other default values.
. Drag a Set Payload connector into the new On Error Propagate error handler.
. Configure the new Set Payload connector:
  .. Double-click *Set Payload* to open the *General* tab.
  .. In *Settings > Value:*, replace `payload` with `error.description`.
. Click *File > Save All* to save your changes.
. Add breakpoints to *Set Payload*, *Logger*, and *Validate size* if you previously removed them.
. Righ-click in the canvas and select *Debug project hello-world*.
. After the app is deployed, send the query `\http://localhost:8081/api/greeting` from Advanced Rest Client, and step through each breakpoint using the curved yellow arrow. 
. When you reach *Set Payload* in *On Error Propagate*, you can see that payload set to the error message we created in Validate size is now the payload.
+
image:payload-message.png[Debugger messages for Set Payload in error handler]
. When you reach *APIkit Router* at the top of the message flow, you can see the error message replaces the original payload `Hi.`.
+
image:payload-response.png[Breakpoint at APIkit Router showing error message in payload]
. When you have stepped all the way through and look at the response in Advanced Rest Client, you'll see that a *500 Server Error* is returned along with the error message.
. Set the original payload back to `Today the greeting is Hello.`.
. Set the view in Studio to *Window > Perspective > Open Perspective > Mule Design*.

Next, we'll publish our revised API.

== Step 4.4: Publish Your Revised API

Make your improved API available on Exchange:

. From the Package Explorer in Studio, right-click the `hello-world` project.
. Select *Anypoint Platform > Publish to Exchange*.
. Be sure to select the same Business Group as you did before. The *Finish* button won't be active until you select a valid business group.
. Accept the version number, which automatically increments for you.
. In *Project type*, select *Example*.
. Click *Finish*.

Studio shows you the direct link to your newly published API version. You can copy it to share with others.

== What Next

Let's deploy our API so that anyone can send a request to the `/greeting` endpoint.
