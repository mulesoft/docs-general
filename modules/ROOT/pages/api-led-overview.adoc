Your customers and employees need data-rich, delightful experiences on a variety of devices.
https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/api-dev/what-is-api-led-connectivity/[API-led connectivity]
ensures you can adapt to changes, reuse solutions efficiently, 
and build security into the digital touchpoints of your business.

Take your first end-to-end, API-led journey in MuleSoft:

. xref:api-led-prerequisites.adoc[Prerequisites]
. xref:api-led-design.adoc[Design an API Specification]
. xref:api-led-develop.adoc[Develop the API]
. xref:api-led-test.adoc[Validation and Error Handling in the API]
. xref:api-led-deploy.adoc[Deploy to CloudHub]
. xref:api-led-operate.adoc[Operate the API]

Once you've experienced the end-to-end journey with a single-resource API that you create, use the model to plan your own connectivity projects.
