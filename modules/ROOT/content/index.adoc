MuleSoft provides the Anypoint Platform to help your organization create integrations and APIs, simplifying the task of connecting multiple data sources.


[[what-is]]
== What is Anypoint Platform?

Anypoint Platform is MuleSoft's *integration application and API suite*. It comprises a unique toolset that enables organizations to create, integrate, model, build, and deploy services, APIs, and Mule applications.

The Anypoint Platform tools are accessed primarily through a browser but also have command line tools and APIs. Through the platform it is possible to control most aspects of integration applications and APIs throughout their entire lifecycle.


== Set up Anypoint Platform

Follow these steps to get an Anypoint Platform account and set up your workstation.

* https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signup?apintent=exchange[Create an Anypoint Platform account].
* Consider the xref:3.8@mule-runtime::hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[MuleSoft hardware and software requirements]
* For development of Mule apps or API design, set up your workstation according to the <<getting-started-dev,Developer Toolkit>>.
* To manage and deploy Mule apps, see the <<getting-started-deploy,Deployment Toolkit>>.
* To set up platform permissions or monitor deployed assets see the <<getting-started-manage,Administrator Toolkit>>.



[[getting-started-dev]]
== Developer Toolkit

After obtaining access to the Anypoint Platform, you are a few steps away from developing integrations with Mule.

. xref:6@studio::download-and-launch-anypoint-studio.adoc[Download and Install Anypoint Studio]. Studio comes with a test Mule server.
. If you are an API developer, ensure you read up on xref:api-manager::index.adoc[API Manager], accessible from Anypoint Platform, to design, publish and manage APIs.
. Check out templates, connectors and more from Anypoint Exchange, where you can find and publish developer resources. You can use Exchange to publish private repositories too.

[NOTE]
If you're working with Mule outside Studio or you have an enterprise license, see how to xref:3.8@mule-runtime::configuring-maven-to-work-with-mule-esb.adoc[Configure Maven] to properly manage the dependencies used by your Mule apps.

[[getting-started-deploy]]
== Deployment Toolkit

For *API deployment*, see xref:api-manager::index.adoc[API Manager], accessible from Anypoint Platform.

For *Mule application deployment*, see xref:runtime-manager::deployment-strategies.adoc[deployment strategies]. This document explains the standard app-to-runtime deployment workflows and tools.


See instructions on how to deploy applications to xref:getting-started:deploy-to-cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] or to xref:getting-started:deploy-to-server.adoc[local Mule runtime instances] via the Anypoint Platform.


[[getting-started-manage]]
== Administrator Toolkit

If you are an administrator, provision access to your organization's Anypoint Platform instance through the xref:access-management::index.adoc[Access Management console].

xref:access-management::external-identity.adoc[Set up external identities] to manage users and clients using your organization's external federated identity system.

To manage Mule apps and servers, use xref:runtime-manager::index.adoc[Runtime Manager], the same platform tool used to deploy apps to Mule anywhere.

For APIs, see xref:api-manager::index.adoc[API Manager] and xref:api-manager::index.adoc[Anypoint Analytics].
