This tutorial covers how to create an Anypoint Platform organization, how to install a Mule runtime in a local server and register it on the platform and then how to deploy an application to it via the Anypoint Platform.


Completing this tutorial should take about 20 minutes. You will accomplish the following:

* Create an account and organization in the Anypoint Platform
* Install Mule runtime in a local server
* Register that server on Runtime Manager
* Upload, deploy, and run a Mule project

Take a look at xref:runtime-manager::deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Strategies] and xref:runtime-manager::managing-servers.adoc[Managing Servers] so that you're familiar with the different alternatives for deploying your Mule applications.

== Create an Anypoint Platform Organization

To deploy applications via the Anypoint Platform, you first need to create an Anypoint Platform account and organization.


. Go to https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[https://anypoint.mulesoft.com] to create a new account in a new organization.
+
*Note*: Otherwise, if you want your account to be part of an existing organization, ask the administrator of that organization to invite you to join it, then create your account via the link she sends to you.

. Enter your information, choose a username and password, then click *Create account*. Your new user account is now created, if you aren't joining an existing organization, then a new organization is created too and your user is made its administrator.


== Install and Run Mule Runtime


. Download the latest version of Mule runtime from the support portal
. Unzip it to a folder of your choice
. Open a command line window and CD to where you unzipped the contents of this file, then CD to the `/bin` folder inside it.
. Run the following command to verify that it works:
+
`./mule start`
. Once you have confirmed that it runs correctly, hit `Ctrl + C` to stop the process.

== Register Server

. Log in to your account on the Anypoint Platform
. Navigate to Runtime Manager, and make sure you're on the correct xref:access-management::environments.adoc[environment].
. Select the *Servers* tab on the left.
. If you haven't added any servers yet, you will see the following instructions on the screen:
+

+
If you already have at least one server registered, then click click *Add Server* to see these instructions.

. Runtime Manager provides you with a default command that includes all of the necessary parameters needed to configure a server to work with Anypoint Platform, including specific keys for your organization. Click *Copy* to copy this command to your clipboard.
. Open a command line window. CD into the `$MULE_HOME/bin` folder
. Paste the command you just copied and run it.
+
Replace “server name” with a server name of your choice.
+
. At this point you should see a success message in response to your command. If you look back at the Servers tab in your browser, you should see a server registered with the name you chose for it:
+

. Back on the command line window, start your server by running `./mule`. Once the server has initialized, you should see the status of the server change from `Created` to `Connected` and then to `Running`.

== Deploy Via Anypoint Platform

In this tutorial, you will deploy a simple Hello World project. You can download the finished project archive link:{attachmentsdir}/basic-tutorial.zip[Here].

See xref:6@studio::importing-and-exporting-in-studio.adoc#exporting-projects-from-studio[Exporting from Studio] for more detailed instructions.

. If you're not there already, log into your Anypoint Platform account and go to the Runtime Manager dashboard.

+

. On the *Applications tab* (selected by default), Click *Deploy application*.
+

. Choose a unique domain under which to deploy the application, for example *helloworld*.
+
[NOTE]
The domain name can be up to 42 characters. A green confirmation check mark is displayed.

. Select an environment in which to deploy your application (such as PRODUCTION or QA).
. Select the deployment target. In this case, it should be the server you just registered.
+
[TIP]
If you don't see your server as an available target, make sure that the _Mule runtime_ application (`./mule`) is currently being executed.
+

. Click *Choose File* and select the link:{attachmentsdir}/basic-tutorial.zip[.zip file that you downloaded] from this tutorial or that you exported from Studio.

. Click *Deploy Application*.
+

. Anypoint Studio packages, uploads, and deploys your application to the server.

[TIP]
For more details about the different deployment settings, see xref:runtime-manager::deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[Deploying to Your Own Servers].

== Running Your App

Once the deployment is complete (which could take a few minutes), open a browser and direct it to one of the application's endpoints.

The example application used by this tutorial listens to `http://localhost:8081/`. If you hit that address, you should see the text "Hello World!";  recall that the application listens for HTTP calls on the root address, sets the payload to the string "Hello World!" and then returns this string as a response to the requester.

This proves you have successfully deployed a Mule application to your new Anypoint Platform account!

[TIP]
You can now manage your application through the xref:runtime-manager::index.adoc[Runtime Manager], access its dashboard, view logs and alerts, and more.
